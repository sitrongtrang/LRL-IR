 <s id="1">It is such a sort of instrumental part of our cooking vocabulary, in terms of the utensils.</s>
 <s id="2">And it was like, that's interesting, there are people who live without chopsticks.</s>

  <s id="3.1">[Small Thing.]</s>
  <s id="3.2">[Big Idea.]</s>
  <s id="3.3">Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks used to eat things with one hand.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">Holding chopsticks is a little bit like holding a pencil, except that you have two of them and you move them together in a pincer movement.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">Most of them are made out of wood.</s>
  <s id="5.2">They're also made out of plastic, bamboo, jade, gold, silver and even ivory, though I think that's not so cool anymore.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">Chopsticks are really well designed for eating small bits of food.</s>
 <s id="7">They're good for picking up noodles.</s>
 <s id="8">If you're skilled, you can eat rice, pick up dumplings, pieces of meat.</s>
 <s id="9">There are some no-nos with chopsticks.</s>
 <s id="10">You should not use the chopsticks like drumsticks, which I know is tempting.</s>
 <s id="11">You don't want to stick chopsticks into a bowl of rice face-up.</s>
 <s id="12">And the reason for that is it actually looks like a bowl of incense, so it sort of echoes death.</s>
 <s id="13">Chopsticks are used in a huge portion of the world, across much of Asia, about 1.5 billion people are covered in the chopsticks sphere.</s>
 <s id="14">Different cultures have slightly different variations of chopsticks.</s>
 <s id="15">Chinese chopsticks will tend to be long and round, Korean chopsticks are flatter and often made of metal and Japanese chopsticks tend to be round and very, very pointy.</s>
 <s id="16">While chopsticks are actually really commonplace in American society today, there was definitely a time in the late 1800s where this idea that Asian men, because they ate rice with sticks, were of a different quality than American men, who ate proper meat with a knife and fork.</s>
 <s id="17">But when China and the United States began their diplomatic engagement in the 1970s, Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, had to practice eating with chopsticks.</s>
 <s id="18">What's been really interesting to see is that as Asian cuisine has moved from the East into the West, chopsticks have become part of the experience.</s>
 <s id="19">There's evidence of chopsticks as long ago as the Shang dynasty, which is about 3000 years ago, and they loved tripods during the Shang dynasty.</s>
 <s id="20">So when you cook with these big tripods, chopsticks were actually really useful, because it was a way for you to stir and to reach without getting burned as the water was boiling in these really big pots.</s>
 <s id="21">Chinese culture has knives and has forks.</s>
 <s id="22">It uses them in many cases for cooking.</s>
 <s id="23">But in terms of like what moved into the dining room, it was the chopsticks.</s>
 <s id="24">One of the things about Asian cooking is that it often comes in very small pieces.</s>
 <s id="25">And I think part of that has to do with the fact that it's actually a lot more energy-efficient to cook little pieces quickly.</s>
 <s id="26">But also, then you don't have to cut them.</s>
 <s id="27">So you have a circular influence, where the type of food that is cooked allows people to use chopsticks, and then the fact that you have chopsticks influences the food that you can cook.</s>
 <s id="28">But at the same time, chopsticks reflect the communal nature of eating food.</s>
 <s id="29">You'll have these dishes that you put in the middle, it's very family style.</s>
 <s id="30">You go in with your chopsticks, and you put it on your rice, and then you eat individually.</s>
 <s id="31">There's actually a famous sort of legend where everyone has these really, really long chopsticks, like way too long for them to feed themselves.</s>
 <s id="32">And so in hell, everyone starves, because they can't pick up food and put it in their mouths.</s>
 <s id="33">But in heaven, people take the same chopsticks and then feed each other.</s>
