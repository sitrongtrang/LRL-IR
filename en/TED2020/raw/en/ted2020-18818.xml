 <s id="1">Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce.</s>
 <s id="2">Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works constantly to orchestrate these changes.</s>
 <s id="3">Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each and every one of your cells.</s>
 <s id="4">The endocrine system relies on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors.</s>
 <s id="5">Firstly, there are several hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body.</s>
 <s id="6">Each is surrounded by a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients to manufacture dozens of hormones.</s>
 <s id="7">Those hormones are then pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream.</s>
 <s id="8">From there, each hormone needs to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change.</s>
 <s id="9">To find its targets, it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside or on the cell’s surface.</s>
 <s id="10">Those receptors recognise specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them.</s>
 <s id="11">When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves.</s>
 <s id="12">By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives large-scale changes across the body.</s>
 <s id="13">Take, for instance, the thyroid and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine.</s>
 <s id="14">These hormones travel to most of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly those cells use energy and how rapidly they work.</s>
 <s id="15">In turn, that regulates everything from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion.</s>
 <s id="16">Hormones also have some of their most visible—and familiar—effects during puberty.</s>
 <s id="17">In men, puberty begins when the testes start secreting testosterone.</s>
 <s id="18">That triggers the gradual development of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase.</s>
 <s id="19">In women, estrogen secreted from the ovaries signals the start of adulthood.</s>
 <s id="20">It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body for menstruation or pregnancy.</s>
 <s id="21">An enduring misconception around the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male and female hormones.</s>
 <s id="22">In fact, men and women have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts.</s>
 <s id="23">Both hormones play a role in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child.</s>
 <s id="24">Such periods of hormonal change are also associated with fluctuations in mood.</s>
 <s id="25">That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals in the brain, like serotonin.</s>
 <s id="26">When chemical levels shift, they may cause changes in mood, as well.</s>
 <s id="27">But that’s not to say that hormones have unlimited power over us.</s>
 <s id="28">They’re frequently viewed as the main drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects, especially during puberty.</s>
 <s id="29">But research shows that our behavior is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors.</s>
 <s id="30">The primary function of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, not control us.</s>
 <s id="31">Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond.</s>
 <s id="32">Diabetes is one of the most common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels.</s>
 <s id="33">And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes too little or too much thyroid hormone.</s>
 <s id="34">When there’s too little thyroid hormone, that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability.</s>
 <s id="35">But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep our bodies in a state of balance.</s>
 <s id="36">And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately help us become who we are.</s>
