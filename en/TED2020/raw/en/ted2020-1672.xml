 <s id="1">There's a group of people in Kenya.</s>
 <s id="2">People cross oceans to go see them.</s>
 <s id="3">These people are tall.</s>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">They jump high.</s>
  <s id="4.2">They wear red.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">And they kill lions.</s>
 <s id="6">You might be wondering, who are these people?</s>
 <s id="7">These are the Maasais.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">And you know what's cool?</s>
  <s id="8.2">I'm actually one of them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.</s>
 <s id="10">The girls are brought up to be mothers.</s>
 <s id="11">When I was five years old, I found out that I was engaged to be married as soon as I reached puberty.</s>
 <s id="12">My mother, my grandmother, my aunties, they constantly reminded me that your husband just passed by.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) Cool, yeah?</s>
 <s id="14">And everything I had to do from that moment was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.</s>
 <s id="15">My day started at 5 in the morning, milking the cows, sweeping the house, cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.</s>
 <s id="16">I did everything that I needed to do to become a perfect wife.</s>
 <s id="17">I went to school not because the Maasais' women or girls were going to school.</s>
 <s id="18">It's because my mother was denied an education, and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living.</s>
 <s id="19">Why did she say that?</s>
 <s id="20">My father worked as a policeman in the city.</s>
 <s id="21">He came home once a year.</s>
 <s id="22">We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.</s>
 <s id="23">And whenever he came home, it was a different case.</s>
 <s id="24">My mother worked hard in the farm to grow crops so that we can eat.</s>
 <s id="25">She reared the cows and the goats so that she can care for us.</s>
 <s id="26">But when my father came, he would sell the cows, he would sell the products we had, and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.</s>
 <s id="27">Because my mother was a woman, she was not allowed to own any property, and by default, everything in my family anyway belongs to my father, so he had the right.</s>
 <s id="28">And if my mother ever questioned him, he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.</s>
 <s id="29">When I went to school, I had a dream.</s>
 <s id="30">I wanted to become a teacher.</s>
 <s id="31">Teachers looked nice.</s>
 <s id="32">They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.</s>
 <s id="33">I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work, that's what I thought, compared to what I was doing in the farm.</s>
 <s id="35">So I wanted to become a teacher.</s>
 <s id="36">I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade, it was a determining factor.</s>
 <s id="37">In our tradition, there is a ceremony that girls have to undergo to become women, and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.</s>
 <s id="38">And then I was just finishing my eighth grade, and that was a transition for me to go to high school.</s>
 <s id="39">This was the crossroad.</s>
 <s id="40">Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.</s>
 <s id="41">Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.</s>
 <s id="42">So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan to figure these things out.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">I talked to my father.</s>
  <s id="43.2">I did something that most girls have never done.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="44">I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony if you let me go back to school."</s>
 <s id="45">The reason why, if I ran away, my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.</s>
 <s id="46">It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.</s>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">So he figured out.</s>
  <s id="47.2">"Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">I did.</s>
  <s id="48.2">The ceremony happened.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">It's a whole week long of excitement.</s>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">It's a ceremony.</s>
  <s id="50.2">People are enjoying it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">And the day before the actual ceremony happens, we were dancing, having excitement, and through all the night we did not sleep.</s>
 <p id="p52">
  <s id="52.1">The actual day came, and we walked out of the house that we were dancing in.</s>
  <s id="52.2">Yes, we danced and danced.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="53">We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.</s>
 <s id="54">They were all in a circle.</s>
 <s id="55">And as we danced and danced, and we approached this circle of women, men, women, children, everybody was there.</s>
 <s id="56">There was a woman sitting in the middle of it, and this woman was waiting to hold us.</s>
 <p id="p57">
  <s id="57.1">I was the first.</s>
  <s id="57.2">There were my sisters and a couple of other girls, and as I approached her, she looked at me, and I sat down.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="58">And I sat down, and I opened my legs.</s>
 <s id="59">As I opened my leg, another woman came, and this woman was carrying a knife.</s>
 <s id="60">And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">As you can imagine, I bled.</s>
  <s id="61.2">I bled.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.</s>
 <s id="63">It's something that so many girls -- I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.</s>
 <s id="64">It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife, and it was difficult.</s>
 <s id="65">I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something that most women don't do.</s>
 <s id="66">Three days later, after everybody has left the home, my mom went and brought a nurse.</s>
 <s id="67">We were taken care of.</s>
 <s id="68">Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.</s>
 <s id="69">I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family.</s>
 <s id="70">Well, while I was in high school, something happened.</s>
 <s id="71">I met a young gentleman from our village who had been to the University of Oregon.</s>
 <s id="72">This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera, white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.</s>
 <s id="73">There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.</s>
 <p id="p74">
  <s id="74.1">They were sneakers, and this is in a village that doesn't even have paved roads.</s>
  <s id="74.2">It was quite attractive.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="75">I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are," because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.</s>
 <s id="76">And he told me, "Well, what do you mean, you want to go?</s>
 <s id="77">Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"</s>
 <s id="78">And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.</s>
 <s id="79">Just tell me how to get there."</s>
 <s id="80">This gentleman, he helped me.</s>
 <s id="81">While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.</s>
 <s id="82">He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick, so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.</s>
 <s id="83">But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.</s>
 <s id="84">Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community, is my father by default -- my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.</s>
 <s id="85">So the news came, I applied to school and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, and I couldn't come without the support of the village, because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.</s>
 <s id="86">I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.</s>
 <s id="87">But I needed the support of the village, and here again, when the men heard, and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school, they said, "What a lost opportunity.</s>
 <p id="p88">
  <s id="88.1">This should have been given to a boy.</s>
  <s id="88.2">We can't do this."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="89">So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.</s>
 <s id="90">There's a belief among our people that morning brings good news.</s>
 <s id="91">So I had to come up with something to do with the morning, because there's good news in the morning.</s>
 <s id="92">And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder, who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.</s>
 <s id="93">So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.</s>
 <s id="94">The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.</s>
 <s id="95">"My child, what are you doing here?"</s>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">"Well, Dad, I need help.</s>
  <s id="96.2">Can you support me to go to America?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="97">I promised him that I would be the best girl, I will come back, anything they wanted after that, I will do it for them.</s>
 <s id="98">He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."</s>
 <s id="99">He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went -- 16 more men -- every single morning I went and visited them.</s>
 <s id="100">They all came together.</s>
 <s id="101">The village, the women, the men, everybody came together to support me to come to get an education.</s>
 <p id="p102">
  <s id="102.1">I arrived in America.</s>
  <s id="102.2">As you can imagine, what did I find?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="103">I found snow!</s>
 <s id="104">I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners, and lots of food in the cafeteria.</s>
 <s id="105">I was in a land of plenty.</s>
 <s id="106">I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here, I discovered a lot of things.</s>
 <s id="107">I learned that that ceremony that I went through when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.</s>
 <s id="108">I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.</s>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body to get an education.</s>
  <s id="109.2">I had a right.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">And as we speak right now, three million girls in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.</s>
 <s id="111">I learned that my mom had a right to own property.</s>
 <s id="112">I learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman.</s>
 <s id="113">Those things made me angry.</s>
 <s id="114">I wanted to do something.</s>
 <s id="115">As I went back, every time I went, I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.</s>
 <s id="116">They were getting mutilated, and here, after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N., I went back to school to get my graduate work, the constant cry of these girls was in my face.</s>
 <s id="117">I had to do something.</s>
 <p id="p118">
  <s id="118.1">As I went back, I started talking to the men, to the village, and mothers, and I said, "I want to give back the way I had promised you that I would come back and help you.</s>
  <s id="118.2">What do you need?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p119">
  <s id="119.1">As I spoke to the women, they told me, "You know what we need?</s>
  <s id="119.2">We really need a school for girls."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="120">Because there had not been any school for girls.</s>
 <s id="121">And the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school, the mother is blamed for that.</s>
 <s id="122">If she got pregnant before she got married, the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.</s>
 <s id="123">She's beaten.</s>
 <s id="124">They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."</s>
 <s id="125">As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers, the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said: "We want a school for boys."</s>
 <s id="126">And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village who have been out and they have gotten an education.</s>
 <s id="127">Why can't they build a school for boys, and I'll build a school for girls?"</s>
 <p id="p128">
  <s id="128.1">That made sense.</s>
  <s id="128.2">And they agreed.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="129">And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.</s>
 <p id="p130">
  <s id="130.1">And they did.</s>
  <s id="130.2">They donated land where we built the girls' school.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="131">We have.</s>
 <s id="132">I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.</s>
 <s id="133">Angeline came to apply for the school, and she did not meet any criteria that we had.</s>
 <p id="p134">
  <s id="134.1">She's an orphan.</s>
  <s id="134.2">Yes, we could have taken her for that.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p135">
  <s id="135.1">But she was older.</s>
  <s id="135.2">She was 12 years old, and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p136">
  <s id="136.1">Angeline had been moving from one place -- because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father -- moving from one grandmother's house to another one, from aunties to aunties.</s>
  <s id="136.2">She had no stability in her life.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="137">And I looked at her, I remember that day, and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.</s>
 <s id="138">And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.</s>
 <s id="139">We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.</s>
 <s id="140">Five months later, that is Angeline.</s>
 <s id="141">A transformation had begun in her life.</s>
 <s id="142">Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world and make a difference.</s>
 <s id="143">She was not the top student when we took her.</s>
 <s id="144">Now she's the best student, not just in our school, but in the entire division that we are in.</s>
 <p id="p145">
  <s id="145.1">That's Sharon.</s>
  <s id="145.2">That's five years later.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p146">
  <s id="146.1">That's Evelyn.</s>
  <s id="146.2">Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="147">As a new dawn is happening in my school, a new beginning is happening.</s>
 <s id="148">As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.</s>
 <s id="149">One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.</s>
 <s id="150">One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.</s>
 <s id="151">This is the thing that we are doing, giving them opportunities where they can rise.</s>
 <s id="152">As we speak right now, women are not being beaten because of the revolutions we've started in our community.</s>
 <s id="153">(Applause) I want to challenge you today.</s>
 <s id="154">You are listening to me because you are here, very optimistic.</s>
 <s id="155">You are somebody who is so passionate.</s>
 <s id="156">You are somebody who wants to see a better world.</s>
 <s id="157">You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.</s>
 <s id="158">You are somebody who wants to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="159">You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.</s>
 <s id="160">I want to challenge you today that to be the first, because people will follow you.</s>
 <p id="p161">
  <s id="161.1">Be the first.</s>
  <s id="161.2">People will follow you.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p162">
  <s id="162.1">Be bold.</s>
  <s id="162.2">Stand up.</s>
  <s id="162.3">Be fearless.</s>
  <s id="162.4">Be confident.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="163">Move out, because as you change your world, as you change your community, as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family, one village, one country at a time.</s>
 <p id="p164">
  <s id="164.1">We are making a difference, so if you change your world, you are going to change your community, you are going to change your country, and think about that.</s>
  <s id="164.2">If you do that, and I do that, aren't we going to create a better future for our children, for your children, for our grandchildren?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p165">
  <s id="165.1">And we will live in a very peaceful world.</s>
  <s id="165.2">Thank you very much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="166">(Applause)</s>
