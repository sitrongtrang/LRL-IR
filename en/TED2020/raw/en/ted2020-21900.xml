 <s id="1">I love football.</s>
 <s id="2">I started playing when I was 12 years old.</s>
 <s id="3">It has been a dominant presence in my life ever since.</s>
 <s id="4">From youth football, to high-school, and college, and now as a coach.</s>
 <s id="5">Football has played a huge role in shaping me as a person.</s>
 <s id="6">Recently, I achieved my dream job of becoming varsity line coach at my high-school alma mater.</s>
 <s id="7">Last March I was at a coaching clinic.</s>
 <s id="8">It was late in the afternoon and I was tired.</s>
 <s id="9">These coaching clinics can tend to be a bit of a drag at times.</s>
 <s id="10">Hours and hours, and days and days of the presentations on the x's and o's of football.</s>
 <s id="11">There was one presentation, though, that looked interesting.</s>
 <s id="12">It was titled "Disneyland."</s>
 <s id="13">This presentation changed my life.</s>
 <s id="14">This talk was not about the x's and o's of football.</s>
 <s id="15">But rather about the emotional truth of why we coaches coach.</s>
 <s id="16">We are coaches so that we can have a meaningful impact on young people's lives, and help them become better people.</s>
 <s id="17">As coaches, we want to have the kind of impact that assure that one day our players can hold hands with their children and walk into Disneyland.</s>
 <s id="18">The moral of this incredible message was this: as coaches, we can preach to our players that it is more important for them be better people than it is great football players.</s>
 <s id="19">But if we are not honest with them and do not practice what we preach, it will never work.</s>
 <s id="20">In other words, teenagers are adept at sensing bullshit.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) As coaches, we must be willing to share our truth.</s>
 <s id="22">And sharing our truth is the only way we can have the kind of impact we truly want to have.</s>
 <s id="23">The coach who gave this presentation, his truth was that his son became a drug addict due to the bullying and pressure he was subjected to from his dad being the head football coach at his school in Eagle, Idaho, a program that at the time was not very succesful.</s>
 <s id="24">I went from a presentation on how to run the power against a 3-4 defense to the most honest, emotional and inspirational talks on coaching philosophy I'd ever heard.</s>
 <s id="25">So it got me thinking.</s>
 <s id="26">What's my bullshit?</s>
 <s id="27">What is unique about me that I bring to the table that will have a meaningful impact?</s>
 <s id="28">What is my truth?</s>
 <s id="29">My truth is this.</s>
 <s id="30">I'm a former college football player.</s>
 <s id="31">I'm a current high-school football coach.</s>
 <s id="32">And I am gay.</s>
 <s id="33">I battled with this truth for a long time.</s>
 <s id="34">Personally, professionally and certainly in my coaching and athletic career.</s>
 <s id="35">It was an identity crisis that had a tremendous impact on my life.</s>
 <s id="36">Long before I heard this presentation on Disneyland I thought about coming out in football.</s>
 <s id="37">In the beginning, I told myself "You're gay and you will take it to the grave."</s>
 <s id="38">Now, I've come a long way since that day.</s>
 <s id="39">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="40">(Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="41">I've come a long way since that day, but the process almost cost me my life.</s>
 <s id="42">I chose to come out to family and friends starting in August of 2014.</s>
 <s id="43">I told my immediate family first, and then I carefully picked my way through family and friends, trying to choose the right time and place.</s>
 <s id="44">Only being part way out of the closet meant that I had to be two different people and always be very aware of where I was and whom I was with.</s>
 <s id="45">It caused a constant state of panic and anxiety.</s>
 <s id="46">So the question became, "Is it important for me to come out publicly?"</s>
 <s id="47">Yes it is, and here is why.</s>
 <s id="48">My time in-and-out of the closet helped my realize that there are other people in my situation.</s>
 <s id="49">And it is not a pretty one.</s>
 <s id="50">It also helped me realize that coming out is not about sharing my bedroom habits, but about giving myself permission to live my life in its entirety.</s>
 <s id="51">Let me explain.</s>
 <s id="52">After talking to one of my fellow coaches, he told me: "I don't talk about my sex life with players, why would you?"</s>
 <s id="53">And it's a legitimate question, but a common misconception about coming out.</s>
 <s id="54">Again, I'm not talking about my sex life.</s>
 <s id="55">I'm talking about my life.</s>
 <s id="56">It's often said that your private life is your private life.</s>
 <s id="57">But imagine you are put in a situation where going virtually anywhere and doing very normal, healthy, human activities with your significant other could have substantial consequences on your life, reputation and career.</s>
 <s id="58">You gain a very new perspective on what your private life actually is.</s>
 <s id="59">That's how being in the closet affected my life.</s>
 <s id="60">It was quite literally a closet.</s>
 <s id="61">No space, no freedom and no comfort.</s>
 <s id="62">It's a suffocating lifestyle with measurable effects.</s>
 <s id="63">It wore me down until eventually I was abusing alcohol and prescription medications to keep my anxiety in check.</s>
 <s id="64">It was a horrible time in my life.</s>
 <s id="65">When you are put in a situation of having to live a double life, it strips you off dignity and normal coping mechanisms.</s>
 <s id="66">At that time the only place I felt somewhat safe was at home.</s>
 <s id="67">I was living with my parents, who had been nothing but supportive, but I did not feel comfortable bringing guys around them yet.</s>
 <s id="68">So there I was.</s>
 <s id="69">No safe place, no place to be myself, facing a new lifestyle I did not know how to navigate, the anxiety and depression were inescapable.</s>
 <s id="70">And I responded the only way I felt I could at the time.</s>
 <s id="71">Drugs and alcohol.</s>
 <s id="72">Football teaches so many great life lessons to those who play or coach.</s>
 <s id="73">Perseverance, toughness, respect, self-esteem.</s>
 <s id="74">But the one negative thing that it does teach is that being gay is not OK.</s>
 <s id="75">To be frank, the word "faggot" is used almost as much as the word "football."</s>
 <s id="76">There is a misconception about the prominence of gay men in football, and it has serious consequences.</s>
 <s id="77">I'm the perfect example of this issue.</s>
 <s id="78">An all-state player in high-school.</s>
 <s id="79">A two-year varsity captain among a select few in school history to go play for a top tier division 1 football program.</s>
 <s id="80">The youngest line coach in the history of the school.</s>
 <s id="81">And I was ready to kill myself.</s>
 <s id="82">Because I thought that even though this program was like a second family to me, I feared they would shun me.</s>
 <s id="83">It was a crushing weight that I was carrying with me all the time.</s>
 <s id="84">Months and months of sleep deprivation, severe anxiety and depression.</s>
 <s id="85">And honestly, a lack of the will to live began to catch up with me.</s>
 <s id="86">It was too much.</s>
 <p id="p87">
  <s id="87.1">I was desperate for a way out.</s>
  <s id="87.2">Any way out.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="88">One night I reached for a bottle of vodka and a couple of pills.</s>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">I didn't see a way out.</s>
  <s id="89.2">I just wanted it to be over.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="90">If I couldn't be me and still live my life, what was the point?</s>
 <s id="91">I passed out on the bathroom floor, and my mom found me.</s>
 <s id="92">I was fortunate to wake up the next day.</s>
 <s id="93">I escaped an overdose.</s>
 <s id="94">It was the scariest moment of my life.</s>
 <s id="95">When I woke up the next day, I knew I really wasn't ready to give up.</s>
 <s id="96">And when I heard that talk on Disneyland, I knew how, when and why it was important for me to share my story.</s>
 <s id="97">I worried for so long about how the football community would react.</s>
 <s id="98">And while at this point only time will tell, my experience has given me a theory.</s>
 <s id="99">It's simple.</s>
 <s id="100">One day, being gay in football will be normal.</s>
 <s id="101">But in order for that to happen, those of us who are gay need to stand up and own it.</s>
 <s id="102">The coaches I know are perfect examples of this.</s>
 <s id="103">I have been met with nothing but love and support from my fellow coaching friends.</s>
 <s id="104">But now the challenge is to change this.</s>
 <s id="105">And not just on the private level.</s>
 <s id="106">The odds of a gay teen or young adult abusing drugs, alcohol, or experiencing anxiety, depression, or even attempting suicide are drastically high.</s>
 <s id="107">When it comes to football, the social norm that we've created leaves many without hope.</s>
 <s id="108">We've made incredible progress in the equal rights movement under the law.</s>
 <s id="109">But now we must tackle a different problem.</s>
 <s id="110">Social equality and the message we send to young people who play football.</s>
 <s id="111">Continue to use sports to inspire, connect and to share a positive message.</s>
 <s id="112">A healthy person cannot live life in the dark.</s>
 <s id="113">And if you are out there, stand up and own it.</s>
 <s id="114">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="115">(Applause)</s>
