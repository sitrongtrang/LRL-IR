 <s id="1">Palms sweaty, heart racing, stomach in knots.</s>
 <s id="2">You can't cry for help.</s>
 <s id="3">Not only is your throat too tight to breathe, but it'd be so embarrassing.</s>
 <s id="4">No, you aren't being stalked by a monster, you're speaking in public, a fate some deem worse than death.</s>
 <s id="5">See, when you're dead, you feel nothing; at a podium, you feel stage fright.</s>
 <s id="6">But at some point we've all had to communicate in front of people, so you have to try and overcome it.</s>
 <s id="7">To start, understand what stage fright is.</s>
 <s id="8">Humans, social animals that we are, are wired to worry about reputation.</s>
 <s id="9">Public speaking can threaten it.</s>
 <s id="10">Before a speech, you fret, "What if people think I'm awful and I'm an idiot?"</s>
 <s id="11">That fear of being seen as an awful idiot is a threat reaction from a primitive part of your brain that's very hard to control.</s>
 <s id="12">It's the fight or flight response, a self-protective process seen in a range of animals, most of which don't give speeches.</s>
 <s id="13">But we have a wise partner in the study of freaking out.</s>
 <s id="14">Charles Darwin tested fight or flight at the London Zoo snake exhibit.</s>
 <s id="15">He wrote in his diary, "My will and reason were powerless against the imagination of a danger which had never been experienced."</s>
 <s id="16">He concluded that his response was an ancient reaction unaffected by the nuances of modern civilization.</s>
 <s id="17">So, to your conscious modern mind, it's a speech.</s>
 <s id="18">To the rest of your brain, built up to code with the law of the jungle, when you perceive the possible consequences of blowing a speech, it's time to run for your life or fight to the death.</s>
 <s id="19">Your hypothalamus, common to all vertebrates, triggers your pituitary gland to secrete the hormone ACTH, making your adrenal gland shoot adrenaline into your blood.</s>
 <s id="20">Your neck and back tense up, you slouch.</s>
 <s id="21">Your legs and hand shake as your muscles prepare for attack.</s>
 <s id="22">You sweat.</s>
 <s id="23">Your blood pressure jumps.</s>
 <s id="24">Your digestion shuts down to maximize the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to muscles and vital organs, so you get dry mouth, butterflies.</s>
 <s id="25">Your pupils dilate, it's hard to read anything up close, like your notes, but long range is easy.</s>
 <s id="26">That's how stage fright works.</s>
 <s id="27">How do we fight it?</s>
 <s id="28">First, perspective.</s>
 <s id="29">This isn't all in your head.</s>
 <s id="30">It's a natural, hormonal, full body reaction by an autonomic nervous system on autopilot.</s>
 <s id="31">And genetics play a huge role in social anxiety.</s>
 <s id="32">John Lennon played live thousands of times.</s>
 <s id="33">Each time he vomited beforehand.</s>
 <s id="34">Some people are just wired to feel more scared performing in public.</s>
 <s id="35">Since stage fright is natural and inevitable, focus on what you can control.</s>
 <s id="36">Practice a lot, starting long before in an environment similar to the real performance.</s>
 <s id="37">Practicing any task increases your familiarity and reduces anxiety, so when it's time to speak in public, you're confident in yourself and the task at hand.</s>
 <s id="38">Steve Jobs rehearsed his epic speeches for hundreds of hours, starting weeks in advance.</s>
 <s id="39">If you know what you're saying, you'll feed off the crowd's energy instead of letting your hypothalamus convince your body it's about to be lunch for a pack of predators.</s>
 <s id="40">But hey, the vertebrate hypothalamus has had millions of years more practice than you.</s>
 <s id="41">Just before you go on stage, it's time to fight dirty and trick your brain.</s>
 <s id="42">Stretch your arms up and breath deeply.</s>
 <s id="43">This makes your hypothalamus trigger a relaxation response.</s>
 <s id="44">Stage fright usually hits hardest right before a presentation, so take that last minute to stretch and breathe.</s>
 <s id="45">You approach the Mic, voice clear, body relaxed.</s>
 <s id="46">Your well-prepared speech convinces the wild crowd you're a charismatic genius.</s>
 <s id="47">How?</s>
 <s id="48">You didn't overcome stage fright, you adapted to it.</s>
 <s id="49">And to the fact that no matter how civilized you may seem, in part of your brain, you're still a wild animal, a profound, well-spoken wild animal.</s>
