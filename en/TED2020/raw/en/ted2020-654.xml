 <s id="1">So, I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves, but first I want to tell you why I'm here.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">I'm here for two reasons.</s>
  <s id="2.2">These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">When Ford was about three years old, we shared a very small room together, in a very small space.</s>
 <s id="4">My office was on one half of the bedroom, and his bedroom was on the other half.</s>
 <s id="5">And you can imagine, if you're a writer, that things would get really crowded around deadlines.</s>
 <s id="6">So when Wren was on the way, I realized I needed to find a space of my own.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">There was no more space in the house.</s>
  <s id="7.2">So I went out to the backyard, and without any previous building experience, and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials, I built this space.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">It had everything I needed.</s>
  <s id="8.2">It was quiet.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">There was enough space.</s>
  <s id="9.2">And I had control, which was very important.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">As I was building this space, I thought to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own."</s>
 <s id="11">So I did some research.</s>
 <s id="12">And I found that there was an historic precedence.</s>
 <s id="13">Hemingway had his writing space.</s>
 <s id="14">Elvis had two or three manspaces, which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.</s>
 <s id="15">In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude, and there was, of course, the Batcave.</s>
 <s id="16">So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Here is one of the first spaces I found.</s>
  <s id="17.2">It is in Austin, Texas, which is where I'm from.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.</s>
 <s id="19">But on the inside, it's anything but.</s>
 <s id="20">And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.</s>
 <s id="21">It has neon concert posters, a bar and, of course, the leg lamp, which is very important.</s>
 <s id="22">I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.</s>
 <s id="23">This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard, out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.</s>
 <s id="24">And he found the scoreboard in the trash.</s>
 <s id="25">Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.</s>
 <s id="26">This a 1923 wooden tugboat, made completely out of Douglas fir.</s>
 <s id="27">The guy did it all himself.</s>
 <s id="28">And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.</s>
 <s id="29">So, pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find, which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.</s>
 <s id="30">There were definitely hang-out spots.</s>
 <s id="31">But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things.</s>
 <s id="32">Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.</s>
 <s id="33">Take this place for example.</s>
 <s id="34">On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.</s>
 <s id="35">This is in Long Island, New York.</s>
 <s id="36">The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.</s>
 <s id="37">On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.</s>
 <s id="38">The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style.</s>
 <s id="39">It has no nails or screws.</s>
 <s id="40">All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">Here is another pretty typical scene.</s>
  <s id="41.2">This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) And so there is a good reason for this.</s>
 <s id="44">It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space.</s>
  <s id="45.2">He trains other people.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.</s>
 <s id="47">So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.</s>
 <s id="48">It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.</s>
 <s id="49">It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.</s>
 <s id="50">Museum quality.</s>
 <s id="51">So, as I came to the end of my journey, I found over 50 spaces.</s>
 <s id="52">And they were unexpected and they were surprising.</s>
 <s id="53">But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were, and how much work went into them.</s>
 <s id="54">And I realized that's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did.</s>
 <s id="55">And they really loved their professions.</s>
 <s id="56">And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.</s>
 <s id="57">And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do, and who they were.</s>
 <s id="58">So if you don't have a space of your own, I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.</s>
 <s id="59">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="60">(Applause)</s>
