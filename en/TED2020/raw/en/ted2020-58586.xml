 <s id="1">So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note?</s>
 <s id="2">It's probably been a while.</s>
 <s id="3">[The Way We Work] Technology has changed the way we communicate.</s>
 <s id="4">We send emails, not letters, text messages, not phone calls.</s>
 <s id="5">We order delivery instead of cooking dinners in our kitchen.</s>
 <s id="6">All in the name of efficiency.</s>
 <s id="7">But here's the point.</s>
 <s id="8">Technology has made it easier to communicate.</s>
 <s id="9">But it hasn't made it easier to connect with other human beings.</s>
 <s id="10">I've found that the secret to connecting in the high-tech, fast-paced world that we live in, is doing a few small things the old-fashioned way.</s>
 <s id="11">Write a letter.</s>
 <s id="12">I've written thousands of handwritten notes.</s>
 <s id="13">Thanking people for advice, thanking them for an interview.</s>
 <s id="14">It just puts that extra effort to show someone that you really care and that you're willing to go above and beyond.</s>
 <s id="15">Some advice for writing a thank-you letter is to really make it clear to the person that you're writing to the impact that they have had on your life.</s>
 <s id="16">Talk about something specific.</s>
 <s id="17">Like "Thank you for the advice that you gave me.</s>
 <s id="18">It's because of the advice you gave me, that I am now doing x."</s>
 <s id="19">People are looking to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="20">And so if you can show someone that they've really had an impact on the life that you're living, the life you're pursuing, it could have a huge impact.</s>
 <s id="21">Pick up the phone and dial.</s>
 <s id="22">We've hired thousands of employees.</s>
 <s id="23">And I've personally called every single one of them to welcome them to the Compass family.</s>
 <s id="24">I'm able to set the tone of really what I want the company to be.</s>
 <s id="25">Where, you know, people go above and beyond to make people feel welcomed and to give people a sense of belonging.</s>
 <s id="26">And sometimes I call people on their last day of work.</s>
 <s id="27">When people leave, sometimes they're more transparent than they ever were when they were still at the company.</s>
 <s id="28">And so it's a great opportunity to get feedback that is very hard to get otherwise.</s>
 <s id="29">Ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the office.</s>
 <s id="30">When I'm traveling the country, every night I'll have dinner with people in the company.</s>
 <s id="31">And I like to ask questions like "What's your underlying motivation?</s>
 <s id="32">What's something that's happened this week that meant a lot to you?"</s>
 <s id="33">And when you go around the table, and people really open up and are able to engage, it sets a different tone.</s>
 <s id="34">When people come back to the office, they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper way.</s>
 <s id="35">Answer questions with honesty.</s>
 <s id="36">You know how it feels when you go into an elevator and someone says, "How was your weekend?"</s>
 <s id="37">It could've been the best weekend ever, you could've met the love of your life, and you would say, "Good, how was yours?"</s>
 <s id="38">If you want to connect with people, then you have to open up.</s>
 <s id="39">I'm not always that good at it, and I imagine most people aren't.</s>
 <s id="40">But that's why being open stands out so much, because most people aren't.</s>
 <s id="41">Turn the video on.</s>
 <s id="42">I would always recommend a videoconference over a phone call.</s>
 <s id="43">Because that's when you can see the real personality come out.</s>
 <s id="44">When you're on video, you're forced to be present.</s>
 <s id="45">It's almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment.</s>
 <s id="46">Nobody succeeds alone.</s>
 <s id="47">The more you can take time to develop genuine, authentic relationships, the more you're going to be able to realize your dreams.</s>
 <s id="48">You're going to be able to take big risks and know that there's a network of people to cheer you on and to support your efforts.</s>
