  <s id="1.1">(Interpreter voice-over) Hello, everyone.</s>
  <s id="1.2">My name is Keith Nolan.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">I’m a cadet private.</s>
 <s id="3">My talk today is on the topic of the military.</s>
 <s id="4">How many of you out there thought you’d ever like to join the military?</s>
 <s id="5">I see a number of you nodding.</s>
 <s id="6">And I thought the same thing ever since I was young.</s>
 <s id="7">Growing up, I’d always wanted to join the military.</s>
 <s id="8">I loved military history and I’ve read a great deal on the subject.</s>
 <s id="9">Also, I have various family members, such as my grandfather and great uncle, who fought in World War II.</s>
 <s id="10">And like them, I wanted the same thing: to serve my country.</s>
 <s id="11">So the question is: Can I?</s>
 <s id="12">No, I can’t.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Why?</s>
  <s id="13.2">Simply because I’m deaf.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">Regardless of that fact, I still had that longing to join the military.</s>
 <s id="15">For example, after I graduated from high school, three months before 9/11 occurred, I went to a naval recruiting center with high hopes of joining the navy.</s>
 <s id="16">I went in and a strapping naval man stood up and addressed me.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">As he was speaking to me, it was impossible for me to read his lips, so I said, “I'm sorry, I’m deaf.”</s>
  <s id="17.2">He tore off a little piece of paper and wrote down three words: “Bad ear.</s>
  <s id="17.3">Disqual.”</s>
  <s id="17.4">He didn't even fully spell out "Disqualified," just: “Bad ear.</s>
  <s id="17.5">Disqual.”</s>
  <s id="17.6">So I went on my way.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">I tried various locations a number of different times, trying to join, but over and over again, I got the same response: “Sorry, you’re deaf.</s>
  <s id="18.2">We can’t accept you.”</s>
  <s id="18.3">So I shifted gears and decided to become a teacher.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">I completed a master's in deaf education and taught for almost two years, until this past spring, when three things occurred that changed that course, the first of which, while I was teaching a high school history class.</s>
 <s id="20">I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War.</s>
 <s id="21">The bell had rung, and I was seated at my desk, when one of my students, who is deaf, approached me and said that he’d like to join the military.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">I said, “Ah, sorry.</s>
  <s id="22.2">You can’t.</s>
  <s id="22.3">You're deaf.”</s>
  <s id="22.4">Then I caught myself.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">It struck me that all along I had been told no, I can’t, and now I was perpetuating that same message to the next generation, to my own student.</s>
 <s id="24">That realization had a large impact that really resonated with me.</s>
 <s id="25">Now, the second thing that happened, my friend had just moved to Israel.</s>
 <s id="26">Did you know that in Israel they accept deaf people into the military?</s>
 <s id="27">How can deaf people be in the military, right?</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">Could this really be true?</s>
  <s id="28.2">Come on!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">Well, I went to Israel last summer to see for myself.</s>
 <s id="30">I interviewed 10 deaf Israeli soldiers, all of those video interviews and questions I’ve compiled, and the findings, I’ll share with you later.</s>
 <s id="31">Thirdly, CSUN here, my alma mater, had recently started up an Army ROTC program.</s>
 <s id="32">ROTC, which stands for Reserve Officer Training Corps, allows students working on their college majors to concurrently participate in the ROTC program.</s>
 <s id="33">Upon graduation, ROTC students have a military career ready and waiting for them.</s>
 <s id="34">So if one joined the army, one could commission as a second lieutenant.</s>
 <s id="35">That's generally the ROTC program here at CSUN.</s>
 <s id="36">Having learned that, I was intrigued.</s>
 <s id="37">I already had a profession as a teacher, but I went ahead anyway and sent an email off to the program, explaining that I was a teacher of the deaf, wondering if I could take a few classes with them and perhaps share their lessons with my students.</s>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">I got an email response back, and surprisingly, it was the first time that I wasn't told, "Sorry, no, you can’t.</s>
  <s id="38.2">You’re deaf."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">It said, "Well, that's interesting.</s>
 <s id="40">I think maybe we can work something out and you can take a few classes with us."</s>
 <s id="41">This was unprecedented.</s>
 <s id="42">So naturally, I was shocked.</s>
 <s id="43">Although I was teaching, I decided I had to grab the opportunity right away and get my foot in the door.</s>
 <s id="44">Altogether, that's how it transpired.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">Now, with all my life experiences, having talked with all the people I had, and given everything I’ve read, I decided to write a research paper called “Deaf in the Military.”</s>
  <s id="45.2">I'll share with you what those 98 pages entail.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">Here in America, we’ve actually had deaf soldiers serving in the past.</s>
 <s id="47">In fact, during the Texas War of Independence, there was a key character named Deaf Smith, who made a large contribution to that war effort.</s>
 <s id="48">For the American Civil War, Gallaudet University actually has archived a list of deaf soldiers in that war from the North and the South, showing that deaf soldiers were even fighting against each other.</s>
 <s id="49">During World War II, there are a few rare examples of deaf people who made it into the military at that time and were able to serve their country as well.</s>
 <s id="50">History illustrates the fact that America has had deaf soldiers, in contrast to today.</s>
 <s id="51">In my paper, I also discuss the deaf Israeli soldiers.</s>
 <s id="52">I learned that they serve in non-combat roles.</s>
 <s id="53">The deaf soldiers are not on the front lines engaged in fire, but rather, are behind the lines serving in supportive roles.</s>
 <s id="54">There are a plethora of various non-combat jobs accessible to the deaf: intelligence, computer technology, map drawing, supply, military dog training -- the list goes on.</s>
 <s id="55">The communication between deaf Israeli soldiers and other soldiers who are hearing is carried out with the same approaches deaf people in general use with the hearing public on a daily basis.</s>
 <s id="56">You can use your voice, lip-read, gestures, sometimes another soldier knows sign language and that can be utilized, pen and paper, texts, computers, emails -- seriously, there’s no magic wand necessary.</s>
 <s id="57">It's the same thing we do every day.</s>
 <s id="58">Interpreters are used there primarily for boot camp training.</s>
 <s id="59">For the average work, it’s not necessary to have an interpreter by your side.</s>
 <s id="60">The Israeli Army is comprised of small groups.</s>
 <s id="61">Each of these units with deaf soldiers have developed their own way of communicating with each other, so there’s no need for interpreters.</s>
 <s id="62">The top picture is of one soldier I met.</s>
 <s id="63">The bottom photo is of Prime Minister Begin with a deaf soldier in Israel.</s>
 <s id="64">Another part of my paper touches on disabled soldiers in the US Military.</s>
 <s id="65">Obviously, military work can be dangerous and involve injury.</s>
 <s id="66">One example here is Captain Luckett.</s>
 <s id="67">Due to an explosion, he lost his leg.</s>
 <s id="68">He’s recovered and currently has a prosthetic leg.</s>
 <s id="69">Now that he’s strong, he's back in combat, still fighting in Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="70">It’s remarkable.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And guess what?</s>
  <s id="71.2">He’s not the only one.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">There are 40 other soldiers like him, amputees who are serving in combat zones.</s>
 <s id="73">Incredible.</s>
 <s id="74">Also, we have a blind soldier here.</s>
 <s id="75">While he was in Iraq, an explosion from a suicide car bomber destroyed his eyesight.</s>
 <s id="76">He’s recovered and hasn’t left the army.</s>
 <s id="77">The army has retained him on active duty, and he’s currently running a hospital for wounded soldiers.</s>
 <s id="78">I also found out online about another soldier, who is deaf in one ear.</s>
 <s id="79">He’s developed civil programs in Iraq, one of which actually started a school for the deaf in Iraq.</s>
 <s id="80">All of this is incredible.</s>
 <s id="81">But I am going to ask all of you: If the US Military can retain their disabled soldiers, why can’t they accept disabled citizens as well?</s>
 <s id="82">Moreover, out of all the US Military jobs, 80% are non-combat positions.</s>
 <s id="83">There are many jobs that we in the Deaf community can do.</s>
 <s id="84">If I were to be in the military, I’d like to do intelligence work.</s>
 <s id="85">But there is an array of other things we can do, such as mechanics, finance, medicine, etc.</s>
 <s id="86">So to summarize, I’ve presented three premises to support my argument, the first being, Israeli defense openly accepts deaf soldiers.</s>
 <s id="87">If you have the qualities and skills required, they’ll take you.</s>
 <s id="88">Secondly, the US Military has accommodations for retaining their disabled soldiers.</s>
 <s id="89">And lastly, 80% of occupations in the military are non-combat.</s>
 <s id="90">Now, can we Deaf Americans serve our country?</s>
 <p id="p91">
  <s id="91.1">Yes!</s>
  <s id="91.2">Of course!</s>
  <s id="91.3">Absolutely, without a doubt!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="92">Now I’ll explain a bit about my experience in the Army ROTC, which began last fall.</s>
 <s id="93">I have been involved with that thus far and it’s still going on now.</s>
 <s id="94">Really, I need to preface this by saying that this is the first time my battalion had ever had a deaf cadet.</s>
 <s id="95">They had never experienced that before.</s>
 <s id="96">So of course, they were taken aback, wondering, initially, how I would do this or that, how would we communicate and such, which is a natural reaction, considering that many of them had never interacted with a deaf person prior to me.</s>
 <s id="97">Plus, I was taken aback by this -- it was the real thing, the army.</s>
 <s id="98">I had to learn a whole new world, full of military jargon, with its own culture and everything.</s>
 <s id="99">So we started out slow, getting to know each other and learning how to work together, progressively.</s>
 <s id="100">For example, on the first day of class, I had no uniform.</s>
 <s id="101">So I showed up in regular clothes, while the other cadets were all in uniform.</s>
 <s id="102">I found out that every morning at 5:30, there was physical training, PT.</s>
 <s id="103">On Fridays, there would be field training -- labs -- off-campus, and occasionally, we would have weekend training at a military base.</s>
 <s id="104">So I showed up, ready, each morning at 5:30, with all the cadets in uniform and me in civilian clothes.</s>
 <s id="105">They told me, “Hey, you know, you don't need to work out.</s>
 <p id="p106">
  <s id="106.1">You can just simply take classes.”</s>
  <s id="106.2">I told them I wanted to, anyway.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="107">They acknowledged that, and I continued to show up every morning to train.</s>
 <s id="108">When Friday came, I asked if I could do the field training.</s>
 <s id="109">I was told no, just stick with class.</s>
 <s id="110">I insisted that I wanted to try.</s>
 <s id="111">Somewhat reluctantly, they let me attend the lab, but only as an observer; I would only be allowed to sit and watch, not participate.</s>
 <s id="112">Alright, so, I showed up on Friday, and watched as the cadets learned marching drill commands, like how to stand at attention, how to properly salute, and all the basics.</s>
 <s id="113">I had to ask again if I could join.</s>
 <s id="114">Finally, I got the go-ahead.</s>
 <s id="115">I went to get in formation.</s>
 <s id="116">I figured I better stand in the second line, so I could watch what the cadets were doing in the row ahead of me.</s>
 <p id="p117">
  <s id="117.1">But the officer who opened the door for me to join the ROTC program spotted me in the back and said, “Hey!</s>
  <s id="117.2">Uh-uh.</s>
  <s id="117.3">I want you in the front.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="118">You want to be a soldier?</s>
 <s id="119">You've got to learn the commands just like the rest of them.</s>
 <p id="p120">
  <s id="120.1">You’re not going to follow other people.</s>
  <s id="120.2">Learn it yourself!”</s>
  <s id="120.3">I thought, "Wow.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="121">He’s viewing me like any person, giving dignity to who I am."</s>
 <s id="122">I was impressed by that.</s>
 <s id="123">So as the weeks went by, I still didn’t have a uniform.</s>
 <s id="124">I asked if it would be possible to get one, but I was told it wasn't.</s>
 <s id="125">So I continued on that way, until one day, I was informed that I’d be getting a uniform.</s>
 <p id="p126">
  <s id="126.1">"Please!"</s>
  <s id="126.2">I said, “Really?</s>
  <s id="126.3">Why?</s>
  <s id="126.4">What changed?”</s>
  <s id="126.5">I was told, “We see your motivation, you show up every morning, dedicated, and always gave a 110% effort.”</s>
  <s id="126.6">They wanted to give me the uniform.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="127">It was remarkable.</s>
 <s id="128">We went to the warehouse to get my uniform.</s>
 <s id="129">I assumed I’d just get a uniform and a pair of boots, nothing more.</s>
 <s id="130">But they filled two duffel bags chock-full of gear: helmet, ammo vest, shovel, sleeping bag -- the whole nine yards.</s>
 <s id="131">I was astonished.</s>
 <s id="132">And I have to tell you, each morning that I get up and put on my uniform, I feel privileged.</s>
 <s id="133">It’s truly an honor to wear the uniform.</s>
 <s id="134">So, moving along, when it came time to train at the garrison base, at first, I was told I couldn’t go.</s>
 <s id="135">There was concern on the ROTC's part that if the interpreter were to get injured during the training, it would be a liability issue.</s>
 <s id="136">So we had to figure out all those issues and confusion, but we worked it out, and in the end, they let me go.</s>
 <s id="137">That's how events were unfolding; I was permitted to do more and more.</s>
 <s id="138">Once, at the garrison base, during one of the training days, a huge Chinook helicopter with its tandem rotors landed right down to us, forcefully spinning exhilaration in the air.</s>
 <s id="139">All of us cadets were supposed to be getting on board.</s>
 <s id="140">Everyone was geared up and ready.</s>
 <s id="141">However, the cadre had decided I wasn’t going to be able to ride the Chinook.</s>
 <s id="142">They were afraid if the pilot shouted out orders, how would I be able to follow the instructions?</s>
 <s id="143">I’d potentially cause a disruption.</s>
 <s id="144">So I had to stand aside, while the others were filing toward the helicopter.</s>
 <s id="145">I could see the cadre huddled up, discussing, mulling it over.</s>
 <p id="p146">
  <s id="146.1">At the last minute, one of them said, “Come on!</s>
  <s id="146.2">Get on the helicopter!”</s>
  <s id="146.3">I rushed over and got in.</s>
  <s id="146.4">It was such a thrill.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="147">And that was the spirit of learning about and supporting one another that carried over.</s>
 <s id="148">And since then, I’ve been involved in everything they do, without any separation.</s>
 <s id="149">This is where my passion lies.</s>
 <p id="p150">
  <s id="150.1">I love them.</s>
  <s id="150.2">I’ll show you some pictures here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="151">Bruin Battalion, Bravo Company -- that’s the name of the group I belong to.</s>
 <s id="152">The cadre are the officers and sergeants who oversee the ROTC program.</s>
 <s id="153">In the beginning, you can see, it was a bit of an awkward phase.</s>
 <s id="154">But once they learned more about me and what I’m capable of doing, there's been tremendous support and unity.</s>
 <s id="155">The cadets, my fellow peers -- well, when you train and sweat together, you feel the bond of camaraderie right away.</s>
 <s id="156">A brother- or sisterly cohesiveness makes them like family.</s>
 <s id="157">In training and military science classes, we learn theories of warfare, how to lead soldiers, how to do reconnaissance, strategies, how to knock out a bunker and land navigation, where you’re finding your way out in the mountains.</s>
 <s id="158">As far as accommodations, I’ve been provided with interpreters through the National Center on Deafness, NCOD, here at CSUN.</s>
 <s id="159">And I really have to thank them, because it's hard to find interpreters who are willing to wake up at 4:30 in the morning, or sometimes even 3:30 in the morning.</s>
 <s id="160">That's the officer who emailed me back, saying I think you can have a few classes with us.</s>
 <s id="161">That's Lieutenant Mendoza.</s>
 <s id="162">That’s my interpreter there, before class starts.</s>
 <s id="163">This is a picture from last fall, when we were new to training.</s>
 <s id="164">This is Lieutenant Colonel Phelps, this being his name sign.</s>
 <s id="165">He's the commanding officer of the entire Bruin Battalion.</s>
 <s id="166">Every time I see him walk by, it’s rather inspiring.</s>
 <s id="167">I mean, the way he presents himself, you can see he’s the epitome of a soldier.</s>
 <s id="168">Plus, he doesn't view me as a deaf person.</s>
 <s id="169">He looks at my skills and capabilities instead.</s>
 <s id="170">He’s really pushed for me, and I respect him for all that.</s>
 <s id="171">That’s me during one of the exercises.</s>
 <s id="172">This is that Chinook helicopter I almost didn’t get on.</s>
 <s id="173">Every cadet has a mentor.</s>
 <s id="174">My mentor is Cinatl.</s>
 <s id="175">He’s a really sharp soldier.</s>
 <s id="176">He teaches me all the finer points and how to execute them ideally.</s>
 <s id="177">This top picture is when a group of us went to Las Vegas to compete in a test, to see if we could match the German troops' physical training standards.</s>
 <s id="178">It involved swimming, timed sprints, marksmanship and numerous fitness events.</s>
 <s id="179">I passed them and satisfied the requirements to be awarded the gold German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge right here.</s>
 <s id="180">This is one of the sergeants, Sergeant Richardson.</s>
 <p id="p181">
  <s id="181.1">I love this guy.</s>
  <s id="181.2">He doesn't take baloney from any of us cadets.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="182">Here I am one morning, when we trekked seven and a half miles with a 40-pound rucksack in less than two hours.</s>
 <s id="183">Here are a few of my fellow cadets.</s>
 <s id="184">I've been with them long enough that I’ve developed name signs for them.</s>
 <s id="185">On the right, here, is Trinidad.</s>
 <s id="186">I gave him this name sign because he's always very sarcastic.</s>
 <s id="187">He's a veteran, having served in Iraq and Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="188">The female is Frigo, whose nickname is "Refrigerator," hence her name sign.</s>
 <s id="189">We’re always competing intellectually in class.</s>
 <p id="p190">
  <s id="190.1">The cadet on the end is Jarvy.</s>
  <s id="190.2">He's a top athlete.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="191">I've given him this sign because of the scar he has here.</s>
 <s id="192">Do you know who this is?</s>
 <s id="193">This is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</s>
 <s id="194">He is the highest-ranking military officer and principal military advisor to President Obama and Secretary of Defense Gates.</s>
 <s id="195">He gave a talk at UCLA to a full house.</s>
 <s id="196">Afterwards, I lined up to shake his hand.</s>
 <p id="p197">
  <s id="197.1">Having done so, I greeted him, “It’s a great pleasure to meet you.”</s>
  <s id="197.2">I signed and my interpreter voiced for me.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="198">Admiral Mullen turned to the interpreter and said, “It’s nice to meet you,” addressing the interpreter, who refrained to clarify.</s>
 <s id="199">He seemed a little confused and just quickly moved on to shake hands with the rest of the soldiers.</s>
 <s id="200">So I’m not sure whether he really knew that I'm deaf or not.</s>
 <s id="201">So everything’s been moving along, gung-ho, full speed ahead, until two weeks ago, when something occurred.</s>
 <s id="202">Well, the ROTC has four levels.</s>
 <s id="203">I’m currently doing the first two levels, which finishes up this May.</s>
 <s id="204">The third level will begin in the fall.</s>
 <s id="205">But in order to move up, you need to pass a medical exam.</s>
 <s id="206">Obviously, I’m deaf, so I’d fail a hearing test.</s>
 <s id="207">So we sat down, and I was told that if I wanted to continue to the third level, I couldn’t do any of the PT workouts in the morning, nor the Friday lab field trainings, nor the army base trainings.</s>
 <s id="208">My uniform, I would have to give back as well.</s>
 <s id="209">I could take the classes, audit them, and that’s all.</s>
 <p id="p210">
  <s id="210.1">It really hit me.</s>
  <s id="210.2">It was a huge blow.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="211">Many of the officers and cadets have empathized with this sudden shock of disappointment, and are wondering why this has to be the case.</s>
 <s id="212">Colonel Phelps has tried to speak with the higher-ups in the chain of command and explain to them that I’m one of the top cadets, having passed all the events and receiving high marks on my exams.</s>
 <s id="213">But their response is unwavering: policy is policy, and if you’re deaf, you’re disqualified.</s>
 <s id="214">I know that the cadre has tried to find various ways.</s>
 <s id="215">They found out that there's a deaf cadet at The Citadel, a military college in South Carolina.</s>
 <s id="216">That particular cadet will be completing his fourth year there and graduating this May.</s>
 <s id="217">Yet, he's in the same predicament that I'm in -- unable to join the army because he’s deaf.</s>
 <s id="218">Yet, all of my fellow cadets and the officers have told me not to give up; the policy must change.</s>
 <s id="219">I was advised to talk with my congressman.</s>
 <s id="220">And I've brought this issue to Henry Waxman, the district congressman here in LA, to get the ball rolling with his advocacy for my cause.</s>
 <s id="221">However, I need your help and support to lobby.</s>
 <s id="222">All of us, you know?</s>
 <s id="223">If you remember back in US history, African-Americans were told they couldn’t join the military, and now they serve.</s>
 <s id="224">Women as well were banned, but now they've been allowed.</s>
 <s id="225">The military has and is changing.</s>
 <p id="p226">
  <s id="226.1">Today is our time.</s>
  <s id="226.2">Now it’s our turn.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="227">Hooah!</s>
 <s id="228">(Applause)</s>
