 <s id="2">So does that.</s>
 <s id="3">This means "mouse."</s>
 <s id="4">"Cat."</s>
 <s id="5">Here we have a story.</s>
 <s id="6">The start of the story, where this means guy, and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.</s>
 <s id="7">Here's where it happens.</s>
 <s id="8">These are when.</s>
 <s id="9">This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.</s>
 <s id="10">She wears it every day.</s>
 <s id="11">It's not considered vintage -- she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.</s>
 <s id="12">Look at her posture; it's remarkable.</s>
 <s id="13">That's because she dances.</s>
 <s id="14">Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring, "Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) And he could say, "Oh my God!"</s>
 <s id="16">or "I heart you!"</s>
 <s id="17">"I'm laughing out loud."</s>
 <s id="18">"I want to give you a hug."</s>
 <s id="19">But he comes up with that, you know.</s>
 <s id="20">He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) Put a crab inside it.</s>
 <s id="22">Add some water.</s>
 <s id="23">Seven different salts.</s>
 <s id="24">He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land, but just panhandle at the ocean.</s>
 <s id="25">He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."</s>
 <s id="26">And the girl goes, "Wha'?"</s>
 <s id="27">So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.</s>
 <s id="28">I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.</s>
 <s id="29">At least, that's how it seems.</s>
 <s id="30">I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.</s>
 <s id="31">Right now, talking to you, I'm not even really a guy.</s>
 <s id="32">I'm a monkey -- (Laughter) -- blowing kisses at a butterfly.</s>
 <s id="33">But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.</s>
 <s id="34">First, soon, and then a lot.</s>
 <s id="35">I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow, but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.</s>
 <s id="36">Hell, ponytail alone.</s>
 <s id="37">I don't know what else to tell you.</s>
 <s id="38">I got a pencil you can borrow.</s>
 <s id="39">You can put it in your phone."</s>
 <s id="40">But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.</s>
 <s id="41">She just says, "No thank you."</s>
 <s id="42">You know?</s>
 <s id="43">[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ] (Applause)</s>
