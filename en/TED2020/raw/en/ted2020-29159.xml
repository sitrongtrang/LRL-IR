 <s id="1">Off the rugged coast of the pacific northwest, pods of killer whales inhabit the frigid waters.</s>
 <s id="2">Each family is able to survive here thanks mainly to one member, its most knowledgeable hunter: the grandmother.</s>
 <s id="3">These matriarchs can live eighty years or more, while most males die off in their thirties.</s>
 <s id="4">Though killer whales inhabit every major ocean, until recently we knew very little about them.</s>
 <s id="5">The details of their lives eluded scientists until an organization called the Center for Whale Research began studying a single population near Washington State and British Columbia in 1976.</s>
 <s id="6">Thanks to their ongoing work, we’ve learned a great deal about these whales, known as the Southern Residents.</s>
 <s id="7">And the more we learn, the more this population’s elders’ vital role comes into focus.</s>
 <s id="8">Each grandmother starts her life as a calf born into her mother’s family group, or matriline.</s>
 <s id="9">The family does everything together, hunting and playing, even communicating through their own unique set of calls.</s>
 <s id="10">Both sons and daughters spend their entire lives with their mothers’ families.</s>
 <s id="11">That doesn’t mean a young whale only interacts with her relatives.</s>
 <s id="12">Besides their own special calls, her matriline shares a dialect with nearby families, and they socialize regularly.</s>
 <s id="13">Once a female reaches age fifteen or so, these meetings become opportunities to mate with males from other groups.</s>
 <s id="14">The relationships don’t go much beyond mating— she and her calves stay with her family, while the male returns to his own mother.</s>
 <s id="15">Until approximately age forty, she gives birth every 6 years on average.</s>
 <s id="16">Then, she goes through menopause— which is almost unheard of in the animal kingdom.</s>
 <s id="17">In fact, humans, killer whales and a few other whales are the only species whose females continue to live for years after they stop reproducing.</s>
 <s id="18">After menopause, grandmothers take the lead hunting for salmon, the Southern Residents’ main food source.</s>
 <s id="19">Most of the winter they forage offshore, supplementing salmon with other fish.</s>
 <s id="20">But when the salmon head towards shore in droves to spawn, the killer whales follow.</s>
 <s id="21">The matriarch shows the younger whales where to find the most fertile fishing grounds.</s>
 <s id="22">She also shares up to 90% of the salmon she catches.</s>
 <s id="23">With each passing year, her contributions become more vital: overfishing and habitat destruction have decimated salmon populations, putting the whales at near-constant risk of starvation.</s>
 <s id="24">These grandmothers’ expertise can mean the difference between life and death for their families– but why do they stop having calves?</s>
 <s id="25">It’s almost always advantageous for a female to continue reproducing, even if she also cares for her existing children and grandchildren.</s>
 <s id="26">A couple unique circumstances change this equation for killer whales.</s>
 <s id="27">The fact that neither sons or daughters leave their families of origin is extremely rare— in almost all animal species, one or both sexes disperse.</s>
 <s id="28">This means that as a female killer whale ages, a greater percentage of her family consists of her children and grandchildren, while more distant relatives die off.</s>
 <s id="29">Because older females are more closely related to the group than younger females, they do best to invest in the family as a whole, whereas younger females should invest in reproducing.</s>
 <s id="30">In the killer whale’s environment, every new calf is another mouth to feed on limited, shared resources.</s>
 <s id="31">An older female can further her genes without burdening her family by supporting her adult sons, who sire calves other families will raise.</s>
 <s id="32">This might be why the females have evolved to stop reproducing entirely in middle age.</s>
 <s id="33">Even with the grandmothers’ contributions, the Southern Resident killer whales are critically endangered, largely due to a decline in salmon.</s>
 <s id="34">We urgently need to invest in restoring salmon populations to save them from extinction.</s>
 <s id="35">In the long term, we’ll need more studies like the Center for Whale Research’s.</s>
 <s id="36">What we’ve learned about the Southern Residents may not hold true for other groups.</s>
 <s id="37">By studying other populations closely, we might uncover more startling adaptations, and anticipate their vulnerabilities to human interference before their survival is at risk.</s>
