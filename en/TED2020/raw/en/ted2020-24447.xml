 <s id="1">Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice.</s>
 <s id="2">Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence.</s>
 <s id="3">So what does practice do in our brains to make us better at things?</s>
 <s id="4">Our brains have two kinds of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter.</s>
 <s id="5">The grey matter processes information in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.</s>
 <s id="6">In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers called axons to our muscles.</s>
 <s id="7">So how does practice or repetition affect the inner workings of our brains?</s>
 <s id="8">The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance called myelin.</s>
 <s id="9">And it's this myelin covering, or sheath, that seems to change with practice.</s>
 <s id="10">Myelin is similar to insulation on electrical cables.</s>
 <s id="11">It prevents energy loss from electrical signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently along neural pathways.</s>
 <s id="12">Some recent studies in mice suggest that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath that insulates the axons.</s>
 <s id="13">And the more layers, the greater the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway for information connecting your brain to your muscles.</s>
 <s id="14">So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes to muscle memory, muscles themselves don't really have memory.</s>
 <s id="15">Rather, it may be the myelination of neural pathways that gives these athletes and performers their edge with faster and more efficient neural pathways.</s>
 <s id="16">There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours, days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill.</s>
 <s id="17">While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about the amount of hours of practice.</s>
 <s id="18">It's also the quality and effectiveness of that practice.</s>
 <s id="19">Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one's current abilities.</s>
 <s id="20">So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most out of our practice time?</s>
 <s id="21">Try these tips.</s>
 <s id="22">Focus on the task at hand.</s>
 <s id="23">Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode.</s>
 <s id="24">In one study, researchers observed 260 students studying.</s>
 <s id="25">On average, those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time.</s>
 <s id="26">Laptops, smartphones, and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions.</s>
 <s id="27">Start out slowly or in slow-motion.</s>
 <s id="28">Coordination is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect.</s>
 <s id="29">If you gradually increase the speed of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance of doing them correctly.</s>
 <s id="30">Next, frequent repetitions with allotted breaks are common practice habits of elite performers.</s>
 <s id="31">Studies have shown that many top athletes, musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities related to their craft.</s>
 <s id="32">Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions of limited duration.</s>
 <s id="33">And finally, practice in your brain in vivid detail.</s>
 <s id="34">It's a bit surprising, but a number of studies suggest that once a physical motion has been established, it can be reinforced just by imagining it.</s>
 <s id="35">In one study, 144 basketball players were divided into two groups.</s>
 <s id="36">Group A physically practiced one-handed free throws while Group B only mentally practiced them.</s>
 <s id="37">When they were tested at the end of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount.</s>
 <s id="38">As scientists get closer to unraveling the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice will only improve.</s>
 <s id="39">In the meantime, effective practice is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.</s>
