 <s id="1">A woman in rags emerged from the swamp flanked by seven giant scorpions.</s>
 <s id="2">Carrying a baby, she headed for the nearest village to beg for food.</s>
 <s id="3">She approached a magnificent mansion, but the mistress of the house took one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions and slammed the door in her face.</s>
 <s id="4">So she continued down the road until she came to a cottage.</s>
 <s id="5">The woman there took pity on the stranger and offered her what she could: a simple meal and a bed of straw.</s>
 <s id="6">Her guest was no ordinary beggar.</s>
 <s id="7">She was Isis, the most powerful goddess in Egypt.</s>
 <s id="8">Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who murdered her husband and wanted to murder her infant son, Horus.</s>
 <s id="9">Set was also a powerful god, and he was looking for them.</s>
 <s id="10">So to keep her cover, Isis had to be very discreet— she couldn’t risk using her powers.</s>
 <s id="11">But she was not without aid.</s>
 <s id="12">Serket, goddess of venomous creatures, had sent seven of her fiercest servants to guard Isis and her son.</s>
 <s id="13">As Isis and Horus settled into their humble accommodation, the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy woman had offended their divine mistress.</s>
 <s id="14">They all combined their venom and gave it to one of the seven, Tefen.</s>
 <s id="15">In the dead of night, Tefen crept over to the mansion.</s>
 <s id="16">As he crawled under the door, he saw the owner’s young son sleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting.</s>
 <s id="17">Isis and her hostess were soon awakened by loud wailing.</s>
 <s id="18">As they peered out of the doorway of the cottage, they saw a mother running through the street, weeping as she cradled her son.</s>
 <s id="19">When Isis recognized the woman who had turned her away, she understood what her scorpions had done.</s>
 <s id="20">Isis took the boy in her arms and began to recite a powerful spell: "O poison of Tefen, come out of him and fall upon the ground!</s>
 <s id="21">Poison of Befen, advance not, penetrate no farther, come out of him, and fall upon the ground!</s>
 <s id="22">For I am Isis, the great Enchantress, the Speaker of spells.</s>
 <p id="p23">
  <s id="23.1">Fall down, O poison of Mestet!</s>
  <s id="23.2">Hasten not, poison of Mestetef!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Rise not, poison of Petet and Thetet!</s>
  <s id="24.2">Approach not, poison of Matet!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">With each name she invoked, that scorpion’s poison was neutralized.</s>
 <s id="26">The child stirred, and his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness, offering all her wealth to Isis in repentance.</s>
 <s id="27">The woman who had taken Isis in watched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought under her roof.</s>
 <s id="28">And from that day on, the people learned to make a poultice to treat scorpion bites, speaking magical incantations just as the goddess had.</s>
