 <s id="1">Since their emergence over 200,000 years ago, modern humans have established homes and communities all over the planet.</s>
 <s id="2">But they didn’t do it alone.</s>
 <s id="3">Whatever corner of the globe you find homo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another species nearby: Canis lupus familiaris.</s>
 <s id="4">Whether they’re herding, hunting, sledding, or slouching the sheer variety of domestic dogs is staggering.</s>
 <s id="5">But what makes the story of man’s best friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals: Canis lupus, or the gray wolf.</s>
 <s id="6">When our Paleolithic ancestors first settled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago, wolves were one of their main rivals at the top of the food chain.</s>
 <s id="7">Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure in one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away, these formidable predators didn’t have much competition.</s>
 <s id="8">Much like human hunter-gatherers, they lived and hunted in complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families, and used their social skills to cooperatively take down larger creatures.</s>
 <s id="9">Using these group tactics, they operated as effective persistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point of exhaustion.</s>
 <s id="10">But when pitted against the similar strengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads.</s>
 <s id="11">For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented a serious threat to their territory.</s>
 <s id="12">But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities.</s>
 <s id="13">Wolves that showed less aggression towards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers.</s>
 <s id="14">And as these more docile scavengers outlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves in areas near human populations.</s>
 <s id="15">Over time humans found a multitude of uses for these docile wolves.</s>
 <s id="16">They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels to guard camps and warn of approaching enemies.</s>
 <s id="17">Their similar social structure made it easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands.</s>
 <s id="18">Eventually they moved from the fringes of our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s first domesticated animal.</s>
 <s id="19">The earliest of these Proto-Dogs or Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around 33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that different from their wild cousins.</s>
 <s id="20">They were primarily distinguished by their smaller size and a shorter snout full of comparatively smaller teeth.</s>
 <s id="21">But as human cultures and occupations became more diverse and specialized, so did our friends.</s>
 <s id="22">Short stocky dogs to herd livestock by nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers and foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty.</s>
 <s id="23">With the emergence of kennel clubs and dog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized into breeds, with many new ones bred purely for appearance.</s>
 <s id="24">Sadly, while all dog breeds are the product of artificial selection, some are healthier than others.</s>
 <s id="25">Many of these aesthetic characteristics come with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing or being prone to spinal injuries.</s>
 <s id="26">Humanity’s longest experiment in controlled evolution has had other side effects as well.</s>
 <s id="27">Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile and submissive traits that were pleasing to humans.</s>
 <s id="28">This phenomenon of selecting traits associated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals.</s>
 <s id="29">Thousands of years of co-evolution may even have bonded us chemically.</s>
 <s id="30">Not only can canines understand our emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with feelings of love and protectiveness.</s>
 <s id="31">It might be difficult to fathom how every Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves.</s>
 <s id="32">But the diversity of breeds today is the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance of our Neanderthal cousins.</s>
 <s id="33">And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals can become our fiercest friends.</s>
