  <s id="1.2">Christian Happi: Sentinel is a proactive early warning system to preempt pandemics.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">It is built on three major pillars.</s>
 <s id="3">Pardis Sabeti: The first pillar is Detect.</s>
 <s id="4">Christian and I have been studying infectious diseases together around the world for two decades.</s>
 <s id="5">We have been using genome sequencing.</s>
 <s id="6">Reading out the complete genetic information of a microbe, it allows us to identify viruses, even those we've never seen before, track them as they spread and watch for new mutations.</s>
 <s id="7">And now with the powerful gene-editing technology CRISPR, we can use this genetic information to rapidly design exquisitely sensitive diagnostic tests for any microbe.</s>
 <s id="8">CH: One of these tools is called SHERLOCK.</s>
 <s id="9">It can be used to test known viruses on simple paper strips.</s>
 <s id="10">It is very inexpensive, and frontline health workers can use SHERLOCK to detect the most common or the most threatening viruses within an hour.</s>
 <s id="11">PS: The other tool is CARMEN.</s>
 <s id="12">It requires a lab, but it can test for hundreds of viruses simultaneously.</s>
 <s id="13">So hospital lab staff can test patient samples for a broad range of viruses within a day.</s>
 <s id="14">Our second pillar is Connect.</s>
 <s id="15">Connect everyone and share this information across the public health community.</s>
 <s id="16">In most outbreaks, hospital staff share case information through paper, Excel -- if at all.</s>
 <s id="17">This makes tracking an outbreak through space and time and coordinating a response extremely difficult.</s>
 <s id="18">So we're developing a cloud-based system and mobile applications that connect community health workers, clinicians, public health teams -- everyone -- and allows them to upload data, perform analysis, share insights and coordinate a response and action plan in real time.</s>
 <s id="19">CH: Our third pillar is Empower.</s>
 <s id="20">An outbreak surveillance system can only succeed if we empower frontline health workers that are already out there taking care of communities.</s>
 <s id="21">It requires a lot of training.</s>
 <s id="22">Pardis and I are very much aware of that.</s>
 <s id="23">We've spent the past 10 years training hundreds of young African scientists and clinicians.</s>
 <s id="24">Over the next five years, we will train an additional 1,000 health workers to use Sentinel detection tools and empower them to train their colleagues.</s>
 <s id="25">This way, we will improve the original health care system and integrate surveillance into medical practice.</s>

  <s id="26.1">[Since presenting their Audacious plan at TED, the world has changed ...]</s>
  <s id="26.2">Briar Goldberg: So here we are.</s>
  <s id="26.3">We're recording this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">It's April 7th, 2020, and obviously, we are in the throes of this crazy global pandemic caused by this new coronavirus.</s>
 <s id="28">So you two have been working together forever, and you really came together pretty aggressively with the Ebola crisis back in 2014.</s>
 <s id="29">What does it feel like from your perspective?</s>
 <s id="30">CH: Pretty much six years after the Ebola outbreak, we're really facing another crisis, and we still pretty much, like, we never learned from the previous crisis.</s>
 <s id="31">And that, really, for me, is heartbreaking.</s>
 <s id="32">PS: I think that this pandemic has shown us how unprepared we are everywhere in the world.</s>
 <s id="33">Christian and our partners together had diagnostics at our hospital sites in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Senegal in early February.</s>
 <s id="34">Most states in the United States didn't have it until far later.</s>
 <s id="35">It tells us that we are all in this together, and we are all very much behind the curve.</s>
 <s id="36">BG: So, this Sentinel system is amazing, but I know that the question that's on everybody's mind is: How is that playing into the here and now?</s>
 <s id="37">PS: You know, we describe Sentinel as a pandemic preemption system, and here we are in a pandemic.</s>
 <s id="38">But what's great is that, actually, the same tools you need to preempt a pandemic are the ones that you need to respond to one.</s>
 <s id="39">And so all of the technologies that we have laid out -- the point-of-care testing, the multiplex testing, the discovery and tracking of the virus as it's changing, and the overlay of the mobile applications to dashboard -- are all critical.</s>
 <s id="40">CH: For us, it is a war.</s>
 <s id="41">We are basically committed for 24 hours' turnaround time in order to give results, and that requires for us to work around the clock nonstop.</s>
 <s id="42">So it's a pretty challenging moment.</s>
 <s id="43">We are away from family.</s>
 <s id="44">At least I have the privilege to see family today, and then I'm sure tomorrow I'm heading back in the trenches.</s>
 <s id="45">In my lab, we sequenced the first COVID-19 genome on the African continent, and that really was done within 48 hours.</s>
 <s id="46">This is revolutionary coming from Africa and then making this information available for the global health community to see what the virus within Africa looks like.</s>
 <s id="47">I believe that with technologies and knowledge and then sharing information, we can do better and then we can overcome.</s>
 <s id="48">PS: The whole idea of Sentinel is that we all stand guard over each other.</s>
 <s id="49">We all watch.</s>
 <s id="50">Each one of us is a sentinel.</s>
 <s id="51">Each one of us, being able to monitor what is making us sick, can share that with the rest of our community.</s>
 <s id="52">And I think that is what I profoundly want, is for us to all stand guard and watch over each other.</s>
