 <s id="1">My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.</s>
 <s id="2">I've been making toys for the last 30 years.</s>
 <s id="3">The early '70s, I was in college.</s>
 <s id="4">It was a very revolutionary time.</s>
 <s id="5">It was a political ferment, so to say -- students out in the streets of Paris, revolting against authority.</s>
 <s id="6">America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.</s>
 <s id="7">In India, we had the Naxalite movement, the [unclear] movement.</s>
 <s id="8">But you know, when there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy.</s>
 <s id="9">The National Movement of India was testimony to that.</s>
 <s id="10">Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the National Movement.</s>
 <s id="11">Now in the early '70s, one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools.</s>
 <s id="12">There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.</s>
 <s id="13">At 31, he was not able to relate the kind of [unclear] research, which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.</s>
 <s id="14">So he designed and went and started a village science program.</s>
 <s id="15">Many people were inspired by this.</s>
 <s id="16">The slogan of the early '70s was "Go to the people.</s>
 <s id="17">Live with them; love them.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">Start from what they know.</s>
  <s id="18.2">Build on what they have."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">This was kind of the defining slogan.</s>
 <s id="20">Well I took one year.</s>
 <s id="21">I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.</s>
 <s id="22">I worked there for two years, and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.</s>
 <s id="23">Often one doesn't know what one wants to do, but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.</s>
 <s id="24">So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.</s>
 <s id="25">And it was a turning point.</s>
 <s id="26">It was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.</s>
 <s id="27">So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."</s>
 <s id="28">So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside.</s>
 <s id="29">And one thing which I found was this black rubber.</s>
 <s id="30">This is called a cycle valve tube.</s>
 <s id="31">When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.</s>
 <s id="32">And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">It's a joint of tubes.</s>
  <s id="33.2">You start by teaching angles -- an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">It's like its own little coupling.</s>
 <s id="35">If you have three of them, and you loop them together, well you make a triangle.</s>
 <s id="36">With four, you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kind of polygons.</s>
 <s id="37">And they have some wonderful properties.</s>
 <s id="38">If you look at the hexagon, for instance, it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.</s>
 <s id="39">You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.</s>
 <s id="40">You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.</s>
 <s id="41">But this is very shaky.</s>
 <s id="42">Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.</s>
 <s id="43">Push it and it becomes house shaped.</s>
 <s id="44">This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again, very shaky.</s>
 <s id="45">This square might look very square and prim.</s>
 <s id="46">Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.</s>
 <s id="47">It becomes kite-shaped.</s>
 <s id="48">But give a child a triangle, he can't do a thing to it.</s>
 <s id="49">Why use triangles?</s>
 <s id="50">Because triangles are the only rigid structures.</s>
 <s id="51">We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.</s>
 <s id="52">Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this.</s>
 <s id="53">Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.</s>
 <s id="54">They always make a triangular roof.</s>
 <s id="55">Now this is people science.</s>
 <s id="56">And if you were to just poke a hole over here and put a third matchstick, you'll get a T joint.</s>
 <s id="57">And if I were to poke all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle, I would make a tetrahedron.</s>
 <s id="58">So you make all these 3D shapes.</s>
 <s id="59">You make a tetrahedron like this.</s>
 <s id="60">And once you make these, you make a little house.</s>
 <s id="61">Put this on top.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">You can make a joint of four.</s>
  <s id="62.2">You can make a joint of six.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">You just need a ton.</s>
 <s id="64">Now this was -- you make a joint of six, you make an icosahedron.</s>
 <s id="65">You can play around with it.</s>
 <s id="66">This makes an igloo.</s>
 <s id="67">Now this is in 1978.</s>
 <s id="68">I was a 24-year-old young engineer.</s>
 <s id="69">And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.</s>
 <s id="70">(Applause) If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside, you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.</s>
 <s id="71">Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron, which means the little carbon atom.</s>
 <s id="72">Well since then, I just thought that I've been really privileged to go to over 2,000 schools in my country -- village schools, government schools, municipal schools, Ivy League schools -- I've been invited by most of them.</s>
 <s id="73">And every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.</s>
 <p id="p74">
  <s id="74.1">I see hope.</s>
  <s id="74.2">I see happiness in their faces.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p75">
  <s id="75.1">Children want to make things.</s>
  <s id="75.2">Children want to do things.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="76">Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.</s>
 <s id="77">Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon.</s>
 <p id="p78">
  <s id="78.1">It's a real pump.</s>
  <s id="78.2">You could actually pop the balloon.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="79">And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.</s>
 <s id="80">So all you do is -- it's a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear] This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.</s>
 <s id="81">And this is how you make a valve.</s>
 <s id="82">You put a little sticky tape.</s>
 <s id="83">This is one-way traffic.</s>
 <s id="84">Well we make lots and lots of pumps.</s>
 <s id="85">And this is the other one -- that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts.</s>
 <s id="86">Now this is what you do, is you bend both these legs into a triangle, and you just wrap some tape around.</s>
 <s id="87">And this is the pump.</s>
 <s id="88">And now, if you have this pump, it's like a great, great sprinkler.</s>
 <s id="89">It's like a centrifuge.</s>
 <s id="90">If you spin something, it tends to fly out.</s>
 <s id="91">(Applause) Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh, you would make this with the palmyra leaf.</s>
 <s id="92">Many of our folk toys have great science principles.</s>
 <s id="93">If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.</s>
 <s id="94">If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.</s>
 <s id="95">Right.</s>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">This is a toy which is made from paper.</s>
  <s id="96.2">It's amazing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="97">There are four pictures.</s>
 <s id="98">You see insects, you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies, frogs, snakes, eagles.</s>
 <s id="99">Here's a paper which you could [unclear] -- designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928, Arthur Stone, documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.</s>
 <s id="100">But this is great fun for children.</s>
 <s id="101">They all study about the food chain.</s>
 <s id="102">The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes; the snakes are eaten by the eagles.</s>
 <s id="103">And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper -- A4 size paper -- you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school -- a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.</s>
 <s id="104">In three minutes, you just fold this up.</s>
 <s id="105">And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.</s>
 <s id="106">If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.</s>
 <s id="107">With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.</s>
 <s id="108">Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.</s>
 <s id="109">And you put a little fan here.</s>
 <s id="110">And this is a hundred-year-old toy.</s>
 <s id="111">There have been six major research papers on this.</s>
 <s id="112">There's some grooves over here, you can see.</s>
 <s id="113">And if I take a reed -- if I rub this, something very amazing happens.</s>
 <s id="114">Six major research papers on this.</s>
 <s id="115">As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.</s>
 <s id="116">He wrote a paper on this.</s>
 <p id="p117">
  <s id="117.1">And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.</s>
  <s id="117.2">(Laughter) (Applause) This is there for every child, and every child can enjoy this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="118">If you want to put a colored disk, well all these seven colors coalesce.</s>
 <s id="119">And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back, that white light's made of seven colors, just by spinning this around.</s>
 <s id="120">This is a straw.</s>
 <s id="121">What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner, so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.</s>
 <s id="122">This is a kind of a blowing straw.</s>
 <s id="123">I just put this inside this.</s>
 <s id="124">There's a hole here, and I shut this.</s>
 <s id="125">And this costs very little money to make -- great fun for children to do.</s>
 <s id="126">What we do is make a very simple electric motor.</s>
 <s id="127">Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.</s>
 <s id="128">The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.</s>
 <s id="129">If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.</s>
 <s id="130">This is an old bicycle tube, which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.</s>
 <s id="131">This is a permanent magnet.</s>
 <s id="132">Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.</s>
 <s id="133">It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin.</s>
 <s id="134">We made 30,000.</s>
 <s id="135">Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years, they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.</s>
 <s id="136">When teachers make it, children make it.</s>
 <s id="137">You can see a gleam in their eye.</s>
 <s id="138">They get a thrill of what science is all about.</s>
 <s id="139">And this science is not a rich man's game.</s>
 <s id="140">In a democratic country, science must reach to our most oppressed, to the most marginalized children.</s>
 <s id="141">This program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools.</s>
 <s id="142">Over 100,000 children learn science this way.</s>
 <s id="143">And we're just trying to see possibilities.</s>
 <s id="144">Look, this is the tetrapak -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment.</s>
 <s id="145">There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum -- which are are sealed together.</s>
 <s id="146">They are fused together, so you can't separate them.</s>
 <s id="147">Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron.</s>
 <s id="148">So something which is trash, which is choking all the seabirds, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous -- all the platonic solids can be made with things like this.</s>
 <s id="149">This is a little straw, and what you do is you just nip two corners here, and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.</s>
 <s id="150">You put this in your mouth, and you blow.</s>
 <s id="151">(Honk) It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.</s>
 <s id="152">You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.</s>
 <p id="p153">
  <s id="153.1">I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out.</s>
  <s id="153.2">I'm going to suck in air.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="154">(Honk) So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations.</s>
 <s id="155">The other is that you keep blowing at it, keep making the sound, and you keep cutting it.</s>
 <s id="156">And something very, very nice happens.</s>
 <p id="p157">
  <s id="157.1">(Honk) (Applause) And when you get a very small one -- (Honk) This is what the kids teach you.</s>
  <s id="157.2">You can also do this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="158">Well before I go any further, this is something worth sharing.</s>
 <s id="159">This is a touching slate meant for blind children.</s>
 <s id="160">This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate, and this is my drawing pen, which is basically a film box.</s>
 <s id="161">It's basically like a fisherman's line, a fishing line.</s>
 <s id="162">And this is wool over here.</s>
 <s id="163">If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.</s>
 <s id="164">And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.</s>
 <s id="165">Wool sticks on Velcro.</s>
 <s id="166">There are 12 million blind children in our country -- (Applause) who live in a world of darkness.</s>
 <s id="167">And this has come as a great boon to them.</s>
 <s id="168">There's a factory out there making our children blind, not able to provide them with food, not able to provide them with vitamin A.</s>
 <s id="169">But this has come as a great boon for them.</s>
 <p id="p170">
  <s id="170.1">There are no patents.</s>
  <s id="170.2">Anyone can make it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="171">This is very, very simple.</s>
 <p id="p172">
  <s id="172.1">You can see, this is the generator.</s>
  <s id="172.2">It's a crank generator.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="173">These are two magnets.</s>
 <s id="174">This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.</s>
 <s id="175">Small pulley and two strong magnets.</s>
 <s id="176">And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.</s>
 <s id="177">If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.</s>
 <s id="178">There will be a spinning magnetic field.</s>
 <s id="179">Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.</s>
 <s id="180">And you can see, this LED is going to glow.</s>
 <s id="181">So this is a small crank generator.</s>
 <s id="182">Well, this is, again, it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.</s>
 <s id="183">And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well they just keep going on.</s>
 <s id="184">And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.</s>
 <s id="185">And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.</s>
 <s id="186">Well in the end, what we can also do: we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps.</s>
 <s id="187">This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.</s>
 <p id="p188">
  <s id="188.1">It's a great cricket cap.</s>
  <s id="188.2">(Laughter) (Applause) When first you see Nehru and Gandhi, this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="189">We make lots of toys with newspapers, and this is one of them.</s>
 <s id="190">And this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird.</s>
 <s id="191">All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.</s>
 <s id="192">And if you have one of these birds -- children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.</s>
 <s id="193">And you can see, this is a little fantail bird.</s>
 <s id="194">Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.</s>
 <s id="195">This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."</s>
 <s id="196">The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.</s>
 <s id="197">It goes very slowly.</s>
 <s id="198">And there were lots of passengers on the ship, and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.</s>
 <s id="199">"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance, and I'll provide you with good food and drinks."</s>
 <s id="200">And the captain would wear a cap everyday and join in the regalia.</s>
 <s id="201">The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap.</s>
 <s id="202">That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord.</s>
 <s id="203">And the second night, he would take the same cap and give it another fold.</s>
 <s id="204">And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap.</s>
 <s id="205">And the third night, he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very, very famous cap.</s>
 <s id="206">If you've seen any of our Bollywood films, this is what the policeman wears, it's called a zapalu cap.</s>
 <s id="207">It's been catapulted to international glory.</s>
 <s id="208">And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.</s>
 <s id="209">So that's a ship.</s>
 <s id="210">And now the end: everyone was enjoying the journey very much.</s>
 <s id="211">They were singing and dancing.</s>
 <s id="212">Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.</s>
 <s id="213">And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.</s>
 <s id="214">A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down.</s>
 <s id="215">And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.</s>
 <s id="216">And there's a third one over here.</s>
 <s id="217">This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.</s>
 <s id="218">And the ship sinks, and the captain has lost everything, but for a life jacket.</s>
 <s id="219">Thank you so much.</s>
 <s id="220">(Applause)</s>
