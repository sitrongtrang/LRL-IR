 <s id="1">Escaping slavery; risking everything to save her family; leading a military raid; championing the cause of women’s suffrage; these are just a handful of the accomplishments of one of America’s most courageous heroes.</s>
 <s id="2">Harriet Tubman was born Araminta Ross in Dorchester County, Maryland, in the early 1820s.</s>
 <s id="3">Born into chattel slavery, Araminta, or Minty, was the fifth of nine children.</s>
 <s id="4">Two of Minty’s older sisters were sold to a chain gang.</s>
 <s id="5">Even as a small child, Minty was hired out to different owners, who subjected her to whippings and punishment.</s>
 <s id="6">Young Minty’s life changed forever on an errand to a neighborhood store.</s>
 <s id="7">There, an overseer threw a two-pound weight at a fugitive enslaved person, missed, and struck Minty instead.</s>
 <s id="8">Her injury caused her to experience sleeping spells, which we know of today as narcolepsy, for the rest of her life.</s>
 <s id="9">Minty’s owner tried to sell her, but there were no buyers for an enslaved person who fell into sleeping spells.</s>
 <s id="10">She was instead put to work with her father, Ben Ross, who taught her how to lumber.</s>
 <s id="11">Lumbering increased Minty’s physical strength and put her in touch with free black sailors who shipped the wood to the North.</s>
 <s id="12">From them, Minty learned about the secret communications that occurred along trade routes, information that would prove invaluable later in her life.</s>
 <s id="13">In this mixed atmosphere of free and enslaved blacks working side by side, Minty met John Tubman, a free black man she married in 1844.</s>
 <s id="14">After marriage, she renamed herself Harriet, after her mother.</s>
 <s id="15">Harriet Tubman’s owner died in 1849.</s>
 <s id="16">When his widow planned to sell off her enslaved human beings, Harriet feared she would be sold away from everyone she loved.</s>
 <s id="17">She had heard of an “underground railroad," a secret network of safe houses, boat captains, and wagon drivers willing to harbor fugitive enslaved people on their way north.</s>
 <s id="18">So Tubman fled with two of her brothers, Ben and Harry.</s>
 <s id="19">They eventually turned back, fearing they were lost.</s>
 <s id="20">But in one of her sleeping spells, Harriet dreamed that she could fly like a bird.</s>
 <s id="21">Looking down below, she saw the path to liberation.</s>
 <s id="22">And in the autumn of 1849, she set out on her own, following the North Star to Pennsylvania, and to freedom.</s>
 <s id="23">Tubman returned to the South 13 times to free her niece, brothers, parents, and many others.</s>
 <s id="24">She earned the nickname Black Moses and worked diligently with fellow abolitionists to help enslaved people escape, first to the North, and later to Canada.</s>
 <s id="25">Harriet Tubman worked as a Union army nurse, scout, and spy during the Civil War.</s>
 <s id="26">In 1863, she became the first woman in United States history to plan and lead a military raid, liberating nearly 700 enslaved persons in South Carolina.</s>
 <s id="27">After the war, the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution legally abolished slavery, while the 14th expanded citizenship and the 15th gave voting rights to formerly enslaved black men.</s>
 <s id="28">But she was undaunted, and she persisted.</s>
 <s id="29">She raised funds for formerly enslaved persons and helped build schools and a hospital on their behalf.</s>
 <s id="30">In 1888, Tubman became more active in the fight for women’s right to vote.</s>
 <s id="31">In 1896, she appeared at the founding convention of the National Association of Colored Women in Washington D.C.</s>
 <s id="32">and later at a woman’s suffrage meeting in Rochester, New York.</s>
 <s id="33">There she told the audience: “I was a conductor on the Underground Railroad, and I can say what many others cannot.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">I never ran my train off the track, and I never lost a passenger.”</s>
  <s id="34.2">As her fame grew, various friends and allies helped her in the fight to collect a veteran’s pension for her service in the Union Army.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">In 1899, she was finally granted $20 a month.</s>
 <s id="36">In a fitting twist of fate, the United States Treasury announced in 2016 that Tubman’s image will appear on a redesigned twenty dollar bill.</s>
 <s id="37">Harriet Tubman died on March 10, 1913.</s>
 <s id="38">Even on her deathbed at age 91, she kept the freedom of her people in mind.</s>
 <s id="39">Her final words were: "I go away to prepare a place for you.”</s>
