 <s id="1">I want to tell you a love story.</s>
 <s id="2">But it doesn't have a happy ending.</s>
 <s id="3">Once upon a time, I was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist.</s>
 <s id="4">Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives and one PhD later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean.</s>
 <s id="5">I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy.</s>
 <s id="6">I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and cultures all depend on the sea.</s>
 <s id="7">In the midst of all this, I fell in love.</s>
 <s id="8">With a fish.</s>
 <s id="9">There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs, but the ones I just can't get out of my head are parrotfish.</s>
 <s id="10">Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world, there are 100 species, they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms, but that's the boring stuff.</s>
 <s id="11">I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish.</s>
 <s id="12">First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae.</s>
 <s id="13">They are the lawn mowers of the reef.</s>
 <s id="14">This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land.</s>
 <s id="15">And there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish left out on the reefs to mow it all down.</s>
 <s id="16">OK, second amazing thing.</s>
 <s id="17">After all that eating, they poop fine white sand.</s>
 <s id="18">A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year.</s>
 <s id="19">Sometimes, when scuba diving, I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down.</s>
 <s id="20">So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach, maybe thank of parrotfish.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) Third, they have so much style.</s>
 <s id="22">Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange, polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful.</s>
 <s id="23">Plus, in true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life.</s>
 <s id="24">A juvenile outfit, an intermediate getup, and a terminal look.</s>
 <s id="25">Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male, termed sequential hermaphroditism.</s>
 <s id="26">These large males then gather harems of females to spawn.</s>
 <s id="27">Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo.</s>
 <s id="28">And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive strategies.</s>
 <s id="29">Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body.</s>
 <s id="30">This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites, so they can sleep soundly.</s>
 <s id="31">I mean, how cool is this?</s>
 <s id="32">(Laughter) So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory.</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) But with this love comes heartache.</s>
 <s id="34">Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish.</s>
 <s id="35">Spearfishing took out the large species, midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species.</s>
 <s id="36">As both a marine biologist and a single person, I can tell you, there aren't that many fish in the sea.</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) And then, there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture, and as bustling as carnival.</s>
 <s id="38">Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years.</s>
 <s id="39">An entire ecosystem erased.</s>
 <s id="40">This is devastating, because hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on reefs for their nutrition and income.</s>
 <s id="41">Let that sink in.</s>
 <s id="42">A little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs -- Very Important Parrotfish.</s>
 <s id="43">Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem.</s>
 <s id="44">These are critical efforts, but it's not enough.</s>
 <s id="45">As I stand here today, only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected.</s>
 <s id="46">Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already gone.</s>
 <s id="47">We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction.</s>
 <s id="48">And we, humans, are causing it.</s>
 <s id="49">We also have the solutions.</s>
 <s id="50">Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land.</s>
 <s id="51">But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes, and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it.</s>
 <s id="52">Each of us can contribute, though.</s>
 <s id="53">With our votes, our voices, our food choices, our skills and our dollars.</s>
 <s id="54">We must overhaul both corporate practices and government policies.</s>
 <s id="55">We must transform culture.</s>
 <s id="56">Building community around solutions is the most important thing.</s>
 <s id="57">I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this magnificent planet.</s>
 <s id="58">Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter.</s>
 <s id="59">Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope, but rather a desire to be useful.</s>
 <s id="60">Because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending.</s>
 <s id="61">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="62">(Applause)</s>
