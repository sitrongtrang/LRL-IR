 <s id="1">Without water, a human can only survive for about 100 hours.</s>
 <s id="2">But there's a creature so resilient that it can go without it for decades.</s>
 <s id="3">This one millimeter animal can survive both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels of radiation.</s>
 <s id="4">This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures on Earth, even if it does look more like a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear.</s>
 <s id="5">Most organisms need water to survive.</s>
 <s id="6">Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells.</s>
 <s id="7">But creatures like the tardigrade, also known as the water bear, get around this restriction with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning life without water.</s>
 <s id="8">And however extraordinary, tardigrades aren't alone.</s>
 <s id="9">Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals can all survive drying up.</s>
 <s id="10">For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through something called a tun state.</s>
 <s id="11">They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs inside their body and wait until water returns.</s>
 <s id="12">It's thought that as water becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix.</s>
 <s id="13">Components of the cells that are sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix.</s>
 <s id="14">It's thought that this keeps these molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together.</s>
 <s id="15">Once the organism is rehydrated, the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, functional cells.</s>
 <s id="16">Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space.</s>
 <s id="17">This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades are extraterrestrial beings.</s>
 <s id="18">While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time.</s>
 <s id="19">In fact, this earthly evolution has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others yet to be discovered.</s>
 <s id="20">And because tardigrades are so hardy, they exist just about everywhere.</s>
 <s id="21">They live on every continent, including Antarctica.</s>
 <s id="22">And they're in diverse biomes including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks.</s>
 <s id="23">But you can find tardigrades in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests.</s>
 <s id="24">All you need to find them is a little patience and a microscope.</s>
 <s id="25">Scientists are now to trying to find out whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses.</s>
 <s id="26">If we can understand how they, and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that can cope with Earth's changing climate.</s>
 <s id="27">And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts.</s>
 <s id="28">In the process, tardigrades could even help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much less hospitable than our own?</s>
