 <s id="2">Good morning everybody.</s>
 <s id="3">We are They Might Be Giants.</s>
 <s id="4">(Applause) I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors he wore on the Larry King show and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.</s>
 <s id="5">But I guess that's in keeping, so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation, ladies and gentlemen.</s>
 <s id="6">This is a brand new song.</s>
 <s id="7">In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something that has not been released.</s>
 <s id="8">John, do you want to introduce the song?</s>
 <s id="9">This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature.</s>
 <s id="10">It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.</s>
 <s id="11">♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫ ♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫ ♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫ ♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Catbird is a cat ♫ ♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫ ♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫ ♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫ ♫ Neither one is equal ♫ ♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫ ♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Now the moth ♫ ♫ defeats the mouse and man. ♫ ♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫ ♫ It can't be believed ♫ ♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫ ♫ who's acting like the bird ♫ ♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫ ♫ Got a brand new shipment ♫ ♫ of electrical equipment ♫ ♫ it's addressed to the bottom of the sea. ♫ ♫ Send a tangerine-colored ♫ ♫ nuclear submarine ♫ ♫ with a sticker that says STP. ♫ ♫ Windshield wiper washer fluid ♫ ♫ spraying in the air ... ♫ ♫ headlights under head lice ♫ ♫ under hats lie everywhere. ♫ ♫ Subatomic waves ♫ ♫ to the underwater caves ♫ ♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Now the moth defeats the mouse and man. ♫ ♫ It's messing with the plan. ♫ ♫ It can't be believed ♫ ♫ 'cause it's just a hummingbird moth ♫ ♫ who's acting like a bird ♫ ♫ that thinks it's a bee. ♫ ♫ Is it us or is this messed up? ♫ ♫ Everyone's deforming ♫ ♫ in the presence of the swarming ♫ ♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Protozoa, snakes and horses ♫ ♫ have enlisted in the forces ♫ ♫ of the bee of bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Catbug is a cat ♫ ♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫ ♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫ ♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫ ♫ Neither one is equal ♫ ♫ to the challenge of the freak we'll call ♫ ♫ the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ (Applause) Thanks a lot.</s>
 <s id="12">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="13">So we are past our 1,000th show.</s>
 <s id="14">Probably somewhere around 1,500.</s>
 <s id="15">It's hard to know.</s>
 <s id="16">We've only done two shows in 2007 so far, but our first show was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.</s>
 <s id="17">It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago and I'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed.</s>
 <s id="18">So thank you.</s>
 <s id="19">We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.</s>
 <s id="20">How early can a rock performance begin?</s>
 <s id="21">Not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning.</s>
 <s id="22">I can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic.</s>
 <s id="23">All right.</s>
 <s id="24">So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence.</s>
 <s id="25">This song is called "Asbury Park."</s>
 <s id="26">It's based on a real life experience.</s>
 <s id="27">♫ I ♫ ♫ I got ♫ ♫ I got kicked ♫ ♫ I got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pony. ♫ ♫ I got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫ ♫ where I swore to the guy ♫ ♫ that the guy who took his beer wasn't me. ♫ ♫ Me got ♫ ♫ Me got kicked ♫ ♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pone. ♫ ♫ Stone Pony. ♫ ♫ Me got kicked in the head ♫ ♫ backstage at the Stone Pony ♫ ♫ where I swore to the guy ♫ ♫ that the guy who took his beer ♫ ♫ was a guy dressed like me. ♫ ♫ Not me! ♫ ♫ Not me! ♫ ♫ Not me! ♫ Thank you.</s>
 <s id="28">Marty Beller on the drums over there.</s>
