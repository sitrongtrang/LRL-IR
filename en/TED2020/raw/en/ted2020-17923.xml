 <s id="1">What keeps you up at night?</s>
 <s id="2">Pondering deep questions?</s>
 <s id="3">Excitement about a big trip?</s>
 <s id="4">Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering?</s>
 <s id="5">For many people, this stress is temporary, as its cause is quickly resolved.</s>
 <s id="6">But what if the very thing keeping you awake was stress about losing sleep?</s>
 <s id="7">This seemingly unsolvable loop is at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common sleep disorder.</s>
 <s id="8">Almost anything can cause the occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress.</s>
 <s id="9">And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag can throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule.</s>
 <s id="10">But in most cases, sleep deprivation is short-term.</s>
 <s id="11">Eventually, exhaustion catches up with all of us.</s>
 <s id="12">However, some long-term conditions like respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue.</s>
 <s id="13">And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry associations of restless nights wracked with anxiety.</s>
 <s id="14">Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed.</s>
 <s id="15">So stressed their brains hijack the stress response system, flooding the body with fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals.</s>
 <s id="16">Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones course through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal.</s>
 <s id="17">In this condition, the brain is hunting for potential threats, making it impossible to ignore any slight discomfort or nighttime noise.</s>
 <s id="18">And when insomniacs finally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised.</s>
 <s id="19">Our brain’s primary source of energy is cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows to conserve this glucose for waking hours.</s>
 <s id="20">But PET studies show the adrenaline that prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms.</s>
 <s id="21">While they sleep, their bodies are working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply of energy-giving glucose.</s>
 <s id="22">This symptom of poor sleep leaves insomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion, confusion, and stress, which starts the process all over again.</s>
 <s id="23">When these cycles of stress and restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia.</s>
 <s id="24">And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar to anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression and anxiety.</s>
 <s id="25">So suffering from any one of these conditions increases your risk of experiencing the other two.</s>
 <s id="26">Fortunately, there are ways to break the cycle of sleeplessness.</s>
 <s id="27">Managing the stress that leads to hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments for insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild your relationship with bedtime.</s>
 <s id="28">Make sure your bedroom is dark and comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal.</s>
 <s id="29">Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out with relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling.</s>
 <s id="30">Regulate your metabolism by setting consistent resting and waking times to help orient your body’s biological clock.</s>
 <s id="31">This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body that it’s time for sleep.</s>
 <s id="32">In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication to aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications that help in all cases.</s>
 <s id="33">And over-the-counter sleeping pills can be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal that worsens symptoms.</s>
 <s id="34">But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness is actually due to insomnia.</s>
 <s id="35">Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed with chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common genetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder, or DSPD.</s>
 <s id="36">People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm significantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out of sync with traditional sleeping hours.</s>
 <s id="37">So while they have difficulty falling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress.</s>
 <s id="38">And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably on their own delayed schedule.</s>
 <s id="39">Our sleeping and waking cycle is a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain for our physical and mental wellbeing.</s>
 <s id="40">For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time and effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it.</s>
