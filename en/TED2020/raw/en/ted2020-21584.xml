 <s id="1">I am a visual artist, and I make revolutionary art to propel history forward.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm going to come right out and tell you something: I don't accept the economic foundation, the social relations or the governing ideas of America.</s>
 <s id="3">My art contributes to fundamental change by encouraging an audience to address big questions from that perspective.</s>
 <s id="4">Social change is hard, but ideas matter tremendously.</s>
 <s id="5">When I say I'm an artist, most people think, "Oh, he's a painter."</s>
 <s id="6">Behind me, you can see some of the kind of work I do.</s>
 <s id="7">"Imagine a World Without America" is a painting, but I work in a range of media, including photography, video and performance art.</s>
 <s id="8">A current project, "Slave Rebellion Reenactment," is going to be reenacted on the outskirts of New Orleans this November.</s>
 <s id="9">In 1989, I had an artwork that became the center of controversy over its transgressive use of the American flag.</s>
 <s id="10">"What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"</s>
 <s id="11">is a conceptual work that encouraged audience participation.</s>
 <s id="12">It consisted of a photo montage that had text that read, "What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?"</s>
 <s id="13">Below that were books that people could write responses to that question in, and below that was a flag that people had the option of standing on.</s>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">The photo montage consisted of images of South Korean students burning American flags, holding signs that said, "Yankee go home.</s>
  <s id="14.2">Son of a bitch," and below that were flag-draped coffins coming back from Vietnam.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">People wrote long and short answers.</s>
 <s id="16">Thousands of people engaged with the work in a lot of different languages.</s>
 <s id="17">Some of the people said, "I'm a German girl.</s>
 <s id="18">If we Germans would admire our flag as you all do, we would be called Nazis again.</s>
 <s id="19">I think you do have too much trouble about this flag."</s>
 <s id="20">"I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage, i.e., the jungles of Africa, and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way."</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">"This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system: the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world, including my brother who was shot by a pig, who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.'</s>
  <s id="21.2">That pig was wearing the flag.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity."</s>
 <s id="23">"As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass!</s>
 <s id="24">You should be shot!" -- US Navy Seal Team.</s>
 <s id="25">As you can see, people had very strong reactions about the flag then, as they do now.</s>
 <s id="26">There were demonstrations of veterans in front of the Art Institute of Chicago.</s>
 <s id="27">They chanted things like, "The flag and the artist, hang them both high," evoking images of lynching.</s>
 <s id="28">I received numerous death threats, and bomb threats were phoned in to my school.</s>
 <s id="29">It was a very dangerous situation.</s>
 <s id="30">Later, President Bush called the work "disgraceful," which I viewed as a tremendous honor, and Congress outlawed the work.</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) I became part of a Supreme Court case when I and others defied that law, by burning flags on the steps of the Capitol.</s>
 <s id="32">That action and the subsequent legal and political battle led to a landmark First Amendment decision that prevented the government from demanding patriotism be mandatory.</s>
 <s id="33">But let me back up a bit.</s>
 <s id="34">These people literally wanted me dead.</s>
 <s id="35">What I would do at this moment would make a difference.</s>
 <s id="36">This is me at the exact same moment, eight stories above that crowd.</s>
 <s id="37">It was supposed to be for a photo shoot that was going to take place on the steps where the veterans were at that time.</s>
 <s id="38">It wouldn't have been safe for me to be there, to say the least.</s>
 <s id="39">But it was really important to do that shoot, because while some wanted to kill me, it was also a situation where those who viewed the American flag as standing for everything oppressive in this system felt that they had a voice, and that voice needed to be amplified.</s>
 <s id="40">The point is this: changing anything -- whether it's conventional ideas about US national symbols, traditional thinking challenged by scientific breakthroughs or ousting an authoritarian president -- requires a lot of things.</s>
 <s id="41">It requires courage, luck and also vision and boldness of action.</s>
 <s id="42">But on luck -- I have to say, the photo shoot we did might not have worked out so well.</s>
 <s id="43">We laughed after we were out of the area.</s>
 <s id="44">But the thing is, it was worth the risk because of the stakes that were involved.</s>
 <s id="45">And in this case, the luck led to a wonderful, profound and powerful situation that was also humorous.</s>
 <s id="46">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="47">(Applause)</s>
