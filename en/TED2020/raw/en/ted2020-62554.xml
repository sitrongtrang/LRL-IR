 <s id="2">A true love awoken with a kiss.</s>
 <s id="3">Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s favorite folktales.</s>
 <s id="4">But one of its most famous renditions tells the story without a single word.</s>
 <s id="5">Since premiering in 1890, "The Sleeping Beauty" has become one of the most frequently staged ballets in history.</s>
 <s id="6">So what makes this piece so beloved?</s>
 <s id="7">And what exactly does ballet bring to this— or any other story?</s>
 <s id="8">At the heart of ballet are dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect over thousands of hours of practice.</s>
 <s id="9">This unique set of gestures has been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning and history.</s>
 <s id="10">But you don’t need to study them to understand ballet, any more than you need to study music to be moved by a song.</s>
 <s id="11">And just as composers combine notes and phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures together with new movements to form expressive combinations.</s>
 <s id="12">Working alongside the orchestra’s live score, ballerinas precisely perform these combinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character.</s>
 <s id="13">In "The Sleeping Beauty’s" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts the fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora.</s>
 <s id="14">The Fairy of Generosity delicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking of violins.</s>
 <s id="15">The ballerina moves in perfect harmony with the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill with an elegant bourrée.</s>
 <s id="16">The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing the gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts of electricity from her fingers.</s>
 <s id="17">She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés before decisively jetéing.</s>
 <s id="18">Some movements are even more literal than this.</s>
 <s id="19">The evil fairy Carabosse curses the princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy counters that curse.</s>
 <s id="20">Of course, the relationship between music and movement isn’t always this straightforward.</s>
 <s id="21">While classical ballet gestures often respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers and orchestra align is another choreographic tool.</s>
 <s id="22">Some characters and scenes move in sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge from the orchestra.</s>
 <s id="23">Dancers and musicians maintain this delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation of speed and rhythm.</s>
 <s id="24">But prior to the performance, a ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer and the music.</s>
 <s id="25">Choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second of "The Sleeping Beauty."</s>
 <s id="26">This is particularly noticeable in Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday.</s>
 <s id="27">Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music tumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical phrases to capture her impatience.</s>
 <s id="28">Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing back and forth with “pas de chat”— French for "cat steps"— as she waits for her party to begin.</s>
 <s id="29">Once the celebration starts, it’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing these gestures with grace.</s>
 <s id="30">Aurora has the hardest part of all: her famous Rose Adagio.</s>
 <s id="31">As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array of balances, all en pointe.</s>
 <s id="32">She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, but then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display of physical strength and skill.</s>
 <s id="33">However, it’s not just technique that carries meaning, but also style and personality.</s>
 <s id="34">Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements to convey a wide range of emotion.</s>
 <s id="35">Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence from her suitors.</s>
 <s id="36">Or she can be coy and flirtatious, descending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence.</s>
 <s id="37">"The Sleeping Beauty" offers a showcase for so much of what ballet can do.</s>
 <s id="38">Its graceful spectacle, dramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination of music and movement perfectly reflect the themes of this fantastical romance.</s>
 <s id="39">But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales.</s>
 <s id="40">Ballets can be non-narrative emotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill.</s>
 <s id="41">The artform is always experimenting with a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium for stories old and new.</s>
