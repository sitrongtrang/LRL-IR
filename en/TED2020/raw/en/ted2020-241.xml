 <s id="1">I’m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.</s>
 <s id="2">So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive.</s>
 <s id="3">So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?</s>

  <s id="4.1">So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it.</s>
  <s id="4.2">It’s about 25 years old, and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno -- and we did this little animation.</s>

 <s id="5">And I think that it's maybe interesting, also, that it deals with two problematic issues, which are rising waters and religion.</s>
 <s id="6">Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth, he warned Noah to build an Ark.</s>
 <s id="7">And after Noah built his Ark, I believe he told Noah to warn the people that they must change all their wicked ways before he come upon them and destroy them.</s>
 <s id="8">And when Noah had done built his Ark, I understand that somebody began to rend a song.</s>
 <s id="9">And the song began to move on I understand like this.</s>
 <s id="10">And when Noah had done built his Ark ...</s>

 <s id="14">And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"</s>
 <s id="15">Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?</s>
 <s id="16">Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."</s>
 <s id="17">And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."</s>
 <s id="18">It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.</s>
