 <s id="1">When Nicolas Bourbaki applied to the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential mathematicians of his time.</s>
 <s id="2">He’d published articles in international journals and his textbooks were required reading.</s>
 <s id="3">Yet his application was firmly rejected for one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist.</s>
 <s id="4">Two decades earlier, mathematics was in disarray.</s>
 <s id="5">Many established mathematicians had lost their lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented.</s>
 <s id="6">Different branches used disparate methodology to pursue their own goals.</s>
 <s id="7">And the lack of a shared mathematical language made it difficult to share or expand their work.</s>
 <s id="8">In 1934, a group of French mathematicians were particularly fed up.</s>
 <s id="9">While studying at the prestigious École normale supérieure, they found the textbook for their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one.</s>
 <s id="10">The small group quickly took on new members, and as the project grew, so did their ambition.</s>
 <s id="11">The result was the "Éléments de mathématique," a treatise that sought to create a consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics.</s>
 <s id="12">The text began with a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use to build its argument.</s>
 <s id="13">From there, its authors derived more and more complex theorems that corresponded with work being done across the field.</s>
 <s id="14">But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify consistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems.</s>
 <s id="15">To accomplish this, they gave new, clear definitions to some of the most important mathematical objects, including the function.</s>
 <s id="16">It’s reasonable to think of functions as machines that accept inputs and produce an output.</s>
 <s id="17">But if we think of functions as bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about the logical relationships between them.</s>
 <s id="18">For example, consider a group of numbers and a group of letters.</s>
 <s id="19">We could define a function where every numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish a particularly interesting relationship.</s>
 <s id="20">Alternatively, we could define a function where every numerical input corresponds to a different alphabetical output.</s>
 <s id="21">This second function sets up a logical relationship where performing a process on the input has corresponding effects on its mapped output.</s>
 <s id="22">The group began to define functions by how they mapped elements across domains.</s>
 <s id="23">If a function’s output came from a unique input, they defined it as injective.</s>
 <s id="24">If every output can be mapped onto at least one input, the function was surjective.</s>
 <s id="25">And in bijective functions, each element had perfect one to one correspondence.</s>
 <s id="26">This allowed mathematicians to establish logic that could be translated across the function’s domains in both directions.</s>
 <s id="27">Their systematic approach to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic constrained creativity.</s>
 <s id="28">But this rebellious band of scholars gleefully ignored conventional wisdom.</s>
 <s id="29">They were revolutionizing the field, and they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet.</s>
 <s id="30">They decided to publish "Éléments de mathématique" and all their subsequent work under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki.</s>
 <s id="31">Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s publications became standard references.</s>
 <s id="32">And the group’s members took their prank as seriously as their work.</s>
 <s id="33">Their invented mathematician claimed to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet with his selected collaborators.</s>
 <s id="34">They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, announced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone who doubted his existence.</s>
 <s id="35">In 1968, when they could no longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke the only way they could.</s>
 <s id="36">They printed Bourbaki’s obituary, complete with mathematical puns.</s>
 <s id="37">Despite his apparent death, the group bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today.</s>
 <s id="38">Though he’s not associated with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs much current research.</s>
 <s id="39">And the modern emphasis on formal proofs owes a great deal to his rigorous methods.</s>
 <s id="40">Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— but his legacy is very real.</s>
