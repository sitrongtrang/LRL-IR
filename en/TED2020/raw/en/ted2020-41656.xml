  <s id="1.1">"The Opposites Game" For Patricia Maisch This day my students and I play the Opposites Game with a line from Emily Dickinson.</s>
  <s id="1.2">My life had stood a loaded gun, it goes and I write it on the board, pausing so they can call out the antonyms – My Your Life Death Had stood ?</s>
  <s id="1.3">Will sit A Many Loaded Empty Gun ?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">Gun.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">For a moment, very much like the one between lightning and its sound, the children just stare at me, and then it comes, a flurry, a hail storm of answers – Flower, says one.</s>
  <s id="3.2">No, Book, says another.</s>
  <s id="3.3">That's stupid, cries a third, the opposite of a gun is a pillow.</s>
  <s id="3.4">Or maybe a hug, but not a book, no way is it a book.</s>
  <s id="3.5">With this, the others gather their thoughts and suddenly it’s a shouting match.</s>
  <s id="3.6">No one can agree, for every student there’s a final answer.</s>
  <s id="3.7">It's a song, a prayer, I mean a promise, like a wedding ring, and later a baby.</s>
  <s id="3.8">Or what’s that person who delivers babies?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">A midwife?</s>
  <s id="4.2">Yes, a midwife.</s>
  <s id="4.3">No, that’s wrong.</s>
  <s id="4.4">You're so wrong you’ll never be right again.</s>
  <s id="4.5">It's a whisper, a star, it's saying I love you into your hand and then touching someone's ear.</s>
  <s id="4.6">Are you crazy?</s>
  <s id="4.7">Are you the president of Stupid-land?</s>
  <s id="4.8">You should be, When's the election?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">It’s a teddy bear, a sword, a perfect, perfect peach.</s>
 <s id="6">Go back to the first one, it's a flower, a white rose.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">When the bell rings, I reach for an eraser but a girl snatches it from my hand.</s>
  <s id="7.2">Nothing's decided, she says, We’re not done here.</s>
  <s id="7.3">I leave all the answers on the board.</s>
  <s id="7.4">The next day some of them have stopped talking to each other, they’ve taken sides.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">There's a Flower club.</s>
  <s id="8.2">And a Kitten club.</s>
  <s id="8.3">And two boys calling themselves The Snowballs.</s>
  <s id="8.4">The rest have stuck with the original game, which was to try to write something like poetry.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">It's a diamond, it's a dance, the opposite of a gun is a museum in France.</s>
 <s id="10">It's the moon, it's a mirror, it's the sound of a bell and the hearer.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">The arguing starts again, more shouting, and finally a new club.</s>
  <s id="11.2">For the first time I dare to push them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">Maybe all of you are right, I say.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Well, maybe.</s>
  <s id="13.2">Maybe it's everything we said.</s>
  <s id="13.3">Maybe it’s everything we didn't say.</s>
  <s id="13.4">It's words and the spaces for words.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">They're looking at each other now.</s>
  <s id="14.2">It's everything in this room and outside this room and down the street and in the sky.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">It's everyone on campus and at the mall, and all the people waiting at the hospital.</s>
  <s id="15.2">And at the post office.</s>
  <s id="15.3">And, yeah, it's a flower, too.</s>
  <s id="15.4">All the flowers.</s>
  <s id="15.5">The whole garden.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">The opposite of a gun is wherever you point it.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Don’t write that on the board, they say.</s>
  <s id="17.2">Just say poem.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">Your death will sit through many empty poems.</s>
