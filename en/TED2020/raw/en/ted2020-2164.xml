 <s id="1">Guatemala is recovering from a 36-year armed conflict.</s>
 <s id="2">A conflict that was fought during the Cold War.</s>
 <s id="3">It was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state.</s>
 <s id="4">What we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims, 160,000 of those killed in the communities: small children, men, women, the elderly even.</s>
 <s id="5">And then we have about 40,000 others, the missing, the ones we're still looking for today.</s>
 <s id="6">We call them the Desaparecidos.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, 83 percent of the victims are Mayan victims, victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Central America.</s>
 <s id="8">And only about 17 percent are of European descent.</s>
 <s id="9">But the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us, the police, the military, are the ones that committed most of the crimes.</s>
 <s id="10">Now the families, they want information.</s>
 <s id="11">They want to know what happened.</s>
 <s id="12">They want the bodies of their loved ones.</s>
 <s id="13">But most of all, what they want is they want you, they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong.</s>
 <s id="14">Now, my case was that my father received death threats in 1980.</s>
 <s id="15">And we left.</s>
 <s id="16">We left Guatemala and we came here.</s>
 <s id="17">So I grew up in New York, I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact, and I went to New Utrecht High School and I graduated from Brooklyn College.</s>
 <s id="18">The only thing was that I really didn't know what was happening in Guatemala.</s>
 <s id="19">I didn't care for it; it was too painful.</s>
 <s id="20">But it wasn't till 1995 that I decided to do something about it.</s>
 <s id="21">So I went back.</s>
 <s id="22">I went back to Guatemala, to look for the bodies, to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well.</s>
 <s id="23">The way we work is that we give people information.</s>
 <s id="24">We talk to the family members and we let them choose.</s>
 <s id="25">We let them decide to tell us the stories, to tell us what they saw, to tell us about their loved ones.</s>
 <s id="26">And even more important, we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves.</s>
 <s id="27">A piece, an essence, of who they are.</s>
 <s id="28">And that DNA is what we're going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons.</s>
 <s id="29">While we're doing that, though, we're looking for the bodies.</s>
 <s id="30">And these are skeletons by now, most of these crimes happened 32 years ago.</s>
 <s id="31">When we find the grave, we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body, document it, and exhume it.</s>
 <s id="32">We literally bring the skeleton out of the ground.</s>
 <s id="33">Once we have those bodies, though, we take them back to the city, to our lab, and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things: One is how people died.</s>
 <s id="34">So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound, for example.</s>
 <s id="35">The other thing we want to understand is who they are.</s>
 <s id="36">Whether it's a baby, or an adult.</s>
 <s id="37">Whether it's a woman or a man.</s>
 <s id="38">But when we're done with that analysis what we'll do is we'll take a small fragment of the bone and we'll extract DNA from it.</s>
 <s id="39">We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families, of course.</s>
 <s id="40">The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases.</s>
 <s id="41">The first is the case of the military diary.</s>
 <s id="42">Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999.</s>
 <s id="43">And what you see there is the state following individuals, people that, like you, wanted to change their country, and they jotted everything down.</s>
 <s id="44">And one of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them.</s>
 <s id="45">Inside that yellow rectangle, you see a code, it's a secret code: 300.</s>
 <s id="46">And then you see a date.</s>
 <s id="47">The 300 means "executed" and the date means when they were executed.</s>
 <s id="48">Now that's going to come into play in a second.</s>
 <s id="49">What we did is we conducted an exhumation in 2003, where we exhumed 220 bodies from 53 graves in a military base.</s>
 <s id="50">Grave 9, though, matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares.</s>
 <s id="51">Now Sergio was a professor at the university.</s>
 <s id="52">He graduted from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country.</s>
 <s id="53">And he was captured on February 23, 1984.</s>
 <s id="54">And if you can see there, he was executed on March 29, 1984, which was incredible.</s>
 <s id="55">We had the body, we had the family's information and their DNA, and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened.</s>
 <s id="56">But most important is about two weeks later, we go another hit, another match from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.</s>
 <s id="57">The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family.</s>
 <s id="58">And then we noticed that he was also in the diary.</s>
 <s id="59">But it was amazing to see that he was also executed on March 29, 1984.</s>
 <s id="60">So that led us to think, hmm, how many bodies were in the grave?</s>
 <s id="61">Six.</s>
 <s id="62">So then we said, how many people were executed on March 29, 1984?</s>
 <s id="63">That's right, six as well.</s>
 <s id="64">So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo, Moises and Zoilo.</s>
 <s id="65">All of them executed on the same date, all captured at different locations and at different moments.</s>
 <s id="66">All put in that grave.</s>
 <s id="67">The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families So we went and we looked for them and we found them.</s>
 <s id="68">And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families.</s>
 <s id="69">The other case I want to tell you about is that of a military base called CREOMPAZ.</s>
 <s id="70">It actually means, "to believe in peace," but the acronym really means Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations.</s>
 <s id="71">And this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries, the ones that serve with the U.N.</s>
 <s id="72">and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo.</s>
 <s id="73">Well, we have testimony that said that within this military base, there were bodies, there were graves.</s>
 <s id="74">So we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in, we found the first of 84 graves, a total of 533 bodies.</s>
 <s id="75">Now, if you think about that, peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies.</s>
 <s id="76">It's very ironic.</s>
 <s id="77">But the bodies -- face down, most of them, hands tied behind their backs, blindfolded, all types of trauma -- these were people who were defenseless who were being executed.</s>
 <s id="78">People that 533 families are looking for.</s>
 <s id="79">So we're going to focus on Grave 15.</s>
 <s id="80">Grave 15, what we noticed, was a grave full of women and children, 63 of them.</s>
 <s id="81">And that immediately made us think, my goodness, where is there a case like this?</s>
 <s id="82">When I got to Guatemala in 1995, I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May 14, 1982, where the army came in, killed the men, and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location.</s>
 <s id="83">Well, guess what?</s>
 <s id="84">The clothing from this grave matched the clothing from the region where these people were taken from, where these women and children were taken from.</s>
 <s id="85">So we conducted some DNA analysis, and guess what?</s>
 <s id="86">We identified Martina Rojas and Manuel Chen.</s>
 <s id="87">Both of them disappeared in that case, and now we could prove it.</s>
 <s id="88">We have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base.</s>
 <s id="89">Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.</s>
 <s id="90">His mother went to the river to wash clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.</s>
 <s id="91">That's when the army came and that's when he was taken away in a helicopter and never seen again until we found him in Grave 15.</s>
 <s id="92">So now with science, with archaeology, with anthropology, with genetics, what we're doing is, we're giving a voice to the voiceless.</s>
 <s id="93">But we're doing more than that.</s>
 <s id="94">We're actually providing evidence for trials, like the genocide trial that happened last year in Guatemala where General RÃ­os Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.</s>
 <s id="95">So I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere -- it's happening in Mexico right in front of us today -- and we can't let it go on anymore.</s>
 <s id="96">We have to now come together and decide that we're not going to have any more missing.</s>
 <s id="97">So no more missing, guys.</s>
 <p id="p98">
  <s id="98.1">Okay?</s>
  <s id="98.2">No more missing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="99">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="100">(Applause)</s>
