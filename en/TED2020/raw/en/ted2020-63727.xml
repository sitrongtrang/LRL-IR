 <s id="1">I was the first woman president of an African nation.</s>
 <s id="2">And I do believe more countries ought to try that.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) (Applause and cheers) Once the glass ceiling has been broken, it can never be put back together -- however one would try to do that.</s>
 <s id="4">When I assumed the presidency of Liberia in January 2006, we faced the tremendous challenges of a post-conflict nation: collapsed economy, destroyed infrastructure, dysfunctional institutions, enormous debt, bloated civil service.</s>
 <s id="5">We also faced the challenges of those left behind.</s>
 <s id="6">The primary victims of all civil wars: women and children.</s>
 <s id="7">On my first day in office, I was excited ...</s>
 <s id="8">and I was exhausted.</s>
 <s id="9">It had been a very long climb to where I was.</s>
 <s id="10">Women had been those who suffered most in our civil conflict, and women had been the ones to resolve it.</s>
 <s id="11">Our history records many women of strength and action.</s>
 <s id="12">A President of the United Nations General Assembly, a renowned circuit court judge, a president of the University of Liberia.</s>
 <s id="13">I knew that I had to form a very strong team with the capacity to address the challenges of our nation.</s>
 <s id="14">And I wanted to put women in all top positions.</s>
 <s id="15">But I knew that was not possible.</s>
 <s id="16">And so I settled for putting them in strategic positions.</s>
 <s id="17">I recruited a very able economist from the World Bank to be our minister of finance, to lead our debt-relief effort.</s>
 <s id="18">Another to be the minister of foreign affairs, to reactivate our bilateral and multilateral relationships.</s>
 <s id="19">The first woman chief of police to address the fears of our women, who had suffered so much during the civil war.</s>
 <s id="20">Another to be the minister of gender, to be able to ensure the protection and the participation of women.</s>
 <s id="21">Over time, the minister of justice, the minister of public works, the minister of agriculture, the minister of commerce and industry.</s>
 <s id="22">Participation in leadership was unprecedented in my administration.</s>
 <s id="23">And although I knew that there were not enough women with the experience to form an all-women cabinet -- as I wanted -- I settled to appoint numerous women in junior ministerial positions, as executives, as administrators, in local government, in diplomatic service, in the judiciary, in public institutions.</s>
 <s id="24">It worked.</s>
 <s id="25">At the end of 2012, our economic growth had peaked at nine percent.</s>
 <s id="26">Our infrastructure was being reconstructed at a very fast pace.</s>
 <s id="27">Our institutions were functioning again.</s>
 <s id="28">Our debt of 4.9 billion had been largely canceled.</s>
 <s id="29">We had good relationships with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the African Development Bank.</s>
 <s id="30">We also had good working relationships with all our sister African countries and many nations all over the world.</s>
 <s id="31">Our women could sleep peacefully at night again, without fear.</s>
 <s id="32">Our children were smiling again, as I promised them during my first inaugural address.</s>
 <s id="33">The reputation and credibility of our nation, lost in the many years of conflict, were restored.</s>
 <s id="34">But progress is never guaranteed.</s>
 <s id="35">And in our legislature, in my first term, women were 14 percent.</s>
 <s id="36">In the second term, it declined to eight percent, because the environment was increasingly toxic.</s>
 <s id="37">I had my fair shares of criticism and toxicity.</s>
 <s id="38">Nobody is perfect.</s>
 <s id="39">But there's nothing more predictable than a strong woman who wants to change things, who's brave to speak out, who's bold in action.</s>
 <s id="40">But I'm OK with the criticism.</s>
 <s id="41">I know why I made the decisions I made, and I'm happy with the results.</s>
 <s id="42">But that's why more women leaders are needed.</s>
 <s id="43">For there will always be those who will tear us down, who will tear us apart, because they want the status quo to remain.</s>
 <s id="44">Although sub-Saharan Africa has had major breakthroughs in women's leadership and participation, particularly in the legislature -- in parliament, as it's called -- so many women, 50 percent and over, one of our nations, well over 60 percent, the best in the world -- but we know that's not enough.</s>
 <s id="45">While we must be very thankful and applaud the progress we have made, we know that there is much more work to be done.</s>
 <s id="46">The work will have to address the lingering vestiges of structural ...</s>
 <s id="47">something against women.</s>
 <s id="48">In too many places, political parties are based on patronage, patriarchy, misogyny that try to keep women from their rightful places, that shut them out from taking leadership positions.</s>
 <s id="49">Too often, women face -- while the best performers, while equal or better in competence -- unequal pay.</s>
 <s id="50">And so we must continue to work to change things.</s>
 <s id="51">We must be able to change the stereotyping.</s>
 <s id="52">We must be able to ensure that those structural barriers that have kept women from being able to have the equity they rightfully deserve.</s>
 <s id="53">And we must also work with men.</s>
 <s id="54">Because increasingly, there is recognition that full gender equity will ensure a stronger economy, a more developed nation, a more peaceful nation.</s>
 <s id="55">And that is why we must continue to work.</s>
 <s id="56">And that is why we're partners.</s>
 <s id="57">I will be launching a Center for Women and Development that will bring together -- (Applause) women who have started and are committed to their joining of leadership.</s>
 <s id="58">With women who have excelled and advanced in leadership together.</s>
 <s id="59">Over a 10-year period, we strongly believe that we will create this wave of women who are prepared to take, unabashedly, intentional leadership and influence throughout society.</s>
 <s id="60">This is why -- (Laughs) at 81, I cannot retire.</s>
 <s id="61">(Applause and laughter) (Applause and cheers) Women are working for change in Africa.</s>
 <s id="62">Women are working for change throughout the world.</s>
 <s id="63">I will be with them, and one of them, forever.</s>
 <s id="64">(Applause) Thank you for listening.</s>
 <s id="65">Go out and change the world.</s>
 <s id="66">(Applause and cheers)</s>
