 <s id="1">For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns.</s>
 <s id="2">They finally found it here: in the bats of Shitou Cave.</s>
 <s id="3">The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003.</s>
 <s id="4">Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin.</s>
 <s id="5">There are hundreds of known coronaviruses.</s>
 <s id="6">Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease.</s>
 <s id="7">The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19.</s>
 <s id="8">Of the seven human coronaviruses, four cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections of the nose and throat.</s>
 <s id="9">Two infect the lungs, and cause much more severe illnesses.</s>
 <s id="10">The seventh, which causes COVID-19, has features of each: it spreads easily, but can severely impact the lungs.</s>
 <s id="11">When an infected person coughs, droplets containing the virus spray out.</s>
 <s id="12">The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth.</s>
 <s id="13">Coronaviruses transmit best in enclosed spaces, where people are close together.</s>
 <s id="14">Cold weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out, enabling the virus to survive for longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it.</s>
 <s id="15">These seasonal variations matter more for established viruses.</s>
 <s id="16">But because no one is yet immune to a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread.</s>
 <s id="17">In the body, the protein spikes embed in the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes.</s>
 <s id="18">Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA.</s>
 <s id="19">All viruses are either RNA viruses or DNA viruses.</s>
 <s id="20">RNA viruses tend to be smaller, with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts and replicate quickly in those hosts.</s>
 <s id="21">In general, RNA viruses don’t have a proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do.</s>
 <s id="22">So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have mistakes called mutations.</s>
 <s id="23">Many of these mutations are useless or even harmful.</s>
 <s id="24">But some make the virus better suited for certain environments— like a new host species.</s>
 <s id="25">Epidemics often occur when a virus jumps from animals to humans.</s>
 <s id="26">This is true of the RNA viruses that caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, and the COVID-19 pandemic.</s>
 <s id="27">Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, or strains, of the original one.</s>
 <s id="28">Coronaviruses have a few key differences from most RNA viruses.</s>
 <s id="29">They’re some of the largest, meaning they have the most genes.</s>
 <s id="30">That creates more opportunity for harmful mutations.</s>
 <s id="31">To counteract this risk, coronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication errors and corrects mistakes.</s>
 <s id="32">This makes coronaviruses much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, than other RNA viruses.</s>
 <s id="33">While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate is actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them.</s>
 <s id="34">After an infection, our immune systems can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick.</s>
 <s id="35">But mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off.</s>
 <s id="36">They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored very specifically to a virus.</s>
 <s id="37">That’s why we need a new flu vaccine every year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly that new strains pop up constantly.</s>
 <s id="38">The slower mutation rate of coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, and vaccines might be able to recognize them for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better.</s>
 <s id="39">Still, we don’t know how long our bodies remain immune to different coronaviruses.</s>
 <s id="40">There’s never been an approved treatment or vaccine for a coronavirus.</s>
 <s id="41">We haven’t focused on treating the ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing treatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those treatments completed clinical trials.</s>
 <s id="42">As we continue to encroach on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus jumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, it doesn’t have to be devastating.</s>
