 <s id="1">When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us a little differently.</s>
 <s id="2">Depending on skin color, it will take only minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience the slightest change.</s>
 <s id="3">So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on so many different hues to begin with?</s>
 <s id="4">Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale of human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be a function of biology.</s>
 <s id="5">It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives skin and hair its color.</s>
 <s id="6">This ingredient comes from skin cells called melanocytes and takes two basic forms.</s>
 <s id="7">There's eumelanin, which gives rise to a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the reddish browns of freckles and red hair.</s>
 <s id="8">But humans weren't always like this.</s>
 <s id="9">Our varying skin tones were formed by an evolutionary process driven by the Sun.</s>
 <s id="10">In began some 50,000 years ago when our ancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia.</s>
 <s id="11">These ancient humans lived between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated by the Sun's UV-carrying rays.</s>
 <s id="12">When skin is exposed to UV for long periods of time, the UV light damages the DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn.</s>
 <s id="13">If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms in the skin's melanocytes.</s>
 <s id="14">Sunscreen as we know it today didn't exist 50,000 years ago.</s>
 <s id="15">So how did our ancestors cope with this onslaught of UV?</s>
 <s id="16">The key to survival lay in their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin.</s>
 <s id="17">The type and amount of melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less protected from the sun.</s>
 <s id="18">This comes down to the skin's response as sunlight strikes it.</s>
 <s id="19">When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive receptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin to shield cells from damage.</s>
 <s id="20">For light-skin people, that extra melanin darkens their skin and produces a tan.</s>
 <s id="21">Over the course of generations, humans living at the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher melanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone.</s>
 <s id="22">This built-in sun shield helped protect them from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait on to new generations.</s>
 <s id="23">But soon, some of our Sun-adapted ancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth.</s>
 <s id="24">The further north they traveled, the less direct sunshine they saw.</s>
 <s id="25">This was a problem because although UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit.</s>
 <s id="26">UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones and lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate, and zinc.</s>
 <s id="27">Without it, humans experience serious fatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition known as rickets.</s>
 <s id="28">For humans whose dark skin effectively blocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed a serious threat in the north.</s>
 <s id="29">But some of them happened to produce less melanin.</s>
 <s id="30">They were exposed to small enough amounts of light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin better absorbed the UV light.</s>
 <s id="31">So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce healthy offspring.</s>
 <s id="32">Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions gradually lightened.</s>
 <s id="33">As a result of our ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people with a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin in the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich skin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles.</s>
 <s id="34">Therefore, skin color is little more than an adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun.</s>
 <s id="35">It may absorb light, but it certainly does not reflect character.</s>
