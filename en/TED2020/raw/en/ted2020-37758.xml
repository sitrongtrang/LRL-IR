 <s id="1">Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death.</s>
 <s id="2">One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, predatory antics of...</s>
 <s id="3">a carnivorous plant.</s>
 <s id="4">Around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, or even frogs and rats.</s>
 <s id="5">Scientists believe that carnivory in plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching adaptation holds a major benefit for plants.</s>
 <s id="6">Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</s>
 <s id="7">In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients.</s>
 <s id="8">Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme.</s>
 <s id="9">Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.</s>
 <s id="10">But this pitcher species has an ingredient called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects.</s>
 <s id="11">As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns.</s>
 <s id="12">Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher plant can consume through its leaves.</s>
 <s id="13">Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.</s>
 <s id="14">The second victim faces off with the sticky sundew plant.</s>
 <s id="15">The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage.</s>
 <s id="16">The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.</s>
 <s id="17">As she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body.</s>
 <s id="18">Special tentacles sense her movement and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip.</s>
 <s id="19">Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again to snare their next victim.</s>
 <s id="20">Two down, four to go.</s>
 <s id="21">The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant.</s>
 <s id="22">He enters the roots through a tiny slit in search of food.</s>
 <s id="23">But inside, he quickly loses his way through the tangled labyrinth.</s>
 <s id="24">A forest of curved hairs prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber with flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen.</s>
 <s id="25">In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants.</s>
 <s id="26">She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in.</s>
 <s id="27">Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets digested.</s>
 <s id="28">Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit.</s>
 <s id="29">Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by sweet-smelling nectar.</s>
 <s id="30">The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the world’s most infamous carnivorous plant.</s>
 <s id="31">His landing triggers tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap snap shut around him.</s>
 <s id="32">The spikes interlock to seal his fate.</s>
 <s id="33">Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach that digests the beetle’s soft tissues.</s>
 <s id="34">When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remains.</s>
 <s id="35">The mayfly is the last creature standing.</s>
 <s id="36">As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo.</s>
 <s id="37">She alights on the petals, drinks the nectar, and takes off unscathed.</s>
 <s id="38">These long flower stalks keep certain insects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food.</s>
 <s id="39">Off the mayfly buzzes to live a long and fruitful life– oh.</s>
