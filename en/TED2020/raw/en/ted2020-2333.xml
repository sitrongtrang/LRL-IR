 <s id="1">Last year, I went on my first book tour.</s>
 <s id="2">In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks.</s>
 <s id="3">Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began, alas, with a lie: "Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria," or "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States."</s>
 <s id="4">Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it -- England, America, Ghana, Nigeria -- I thought, "But that's not true."</s>
 <s id="5">Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.</s>
 <s id="6">My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana.</s>
 <s id="7">My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</s>
 <s id="8">For this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational."</s>
 <s id="9">"But Nike is multinational," I thought, "I'm a human being."</s>
 <s id="10">Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann.</s>
 <s id="11">We were discussing the role of locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me.</s>
 <s id="12">I'm not multinational.</s>
 <s id="13">I'm not a national at all.</s>
 <s id="14">How could I come from a nation?</s>
 <s id="15">How can a human being come from a concept?</s>
 <s id="16">It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.</s>
 <s id="17">From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it?</s>
 <s id="18">In my lifetime, countries had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste; failed -- Somalia.</s>
 <s id="19">My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.</s>
 <s id="20">To me, a country -- this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.</s>
 <s id="21">And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.</s>
 <s id="22">What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.</s>
 <s id="23">When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief.</s>
 <s id="24">It was as I had suspected.</s>
 <s id="25">History was real, cultures were real, but countries were invented.</s>
 <s id="26">For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state.</s>
 <s id="27">In 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan," sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.</s>
 <s id="28">It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience, and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.</s>
 <s id="29">"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked, "when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"</s>
 <s id="30">Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant.</s>
 <s id="31">I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana.</s>
 <s id="32">Her parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent.</s>
 <s id="33">Layla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana."</s>
 <s id="34">In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra.</s>
 <s id="35">I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports.</s>
 <s id="36">I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets -- the privileging of a fiction, the singular country, over reality: human experience.</s>
 <s id="37">Speaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.</s>
 <s id="38">"All experience is local," he said.</s>
 <s id="39">"All identity is experience," I thought.</s>
 <s id="40">"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">"I'm a local.</s>
  <s id="41.2">I'm multi-local."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">See, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth.</s>
 <s id="43">I have no relationship with the United States, all 50 of them, not really.</s>
 <s id="44">My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.</s>
 <s id="45">What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur.</s>
 <s id="46">Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.</s>
 <s id="47">My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours.</s>
 <s id="48">These are the places that shape my experience.</s>
 <s id="49">My experience is where I'm from.</s>
 <s id="50">What if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?" -- "Where are you a local?"</s>
 <s id="51">This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.</s>
 <s id="52">Tell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés?</s>
 <s id="53">Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France?</s>
 <s id="54">Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.</s>
 <s id="55">Our experience is where we're from.</s>
 <s id="56">So, where are you a local?</s>
 <s id="57">I propose a three-step test.</s>
 <s id="58">I call these the three "R’s": rituals, relationships, restrictions.</s>
 <s id="59">First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops, saying your prayers.</s>
 <s id="60">What kind of rituals are these?</s>
 <s id="61">Where do they occur?</s>
 <s id="62">In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?</s>
 <s id="63">As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.</s>
 <s id="64">We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly polite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.</s>
 <s id="65">In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South.</s>
 <s id="66">The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt.</s>
 <s id="67">The rituals were familiar.</s>
 <s id="68">"R" number one, rituals.</s>
 <s id="69">Now, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days.</s>
 <s id="70">To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime?</s>
 <s id="71">Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking about your Facebook friends.</s>
 <s id="72">I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.</s>
 <s id="73">My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me.</s>
 <s id="74">"R" number two, relationships.</s>
 <s id="75">We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions.</s>
 <s id="76">By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?</s>
 <s id="77">What passport do you hold?</s>
 <s id="78">Are you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live?</s>
 <s id="79">By civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation, from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child?</s>
 <s id="80">This is the least sexy of the R’s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past "Where are you now?"</s>
 <s id="81">to "Why aren't you there, and why?"</s>
 <s id="82">Rituals, relationships, restrictions.</s>
 <s id="83">Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns, then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.</s>
 <s id="84">A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge.</s>
 <s id="85">So let's try it.</s>
 <s id="86">I have a friend named Olu.</s>
 <s id="87">He's 35 years old.</s>
 <s id="88">His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.</s>
 <s id="89">Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10.</s>
 <s id="90">When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London, then came to Berlin.</s>
 <s id="91">He loves going to Nigeria -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the political corruption there.</s>
 <s id="92">Where is Olu from?</s>
 <s id="93">I have another friend named Udo.</s>
 <s id="94">He's also 35 years old.</s>
 <s id="95">Udo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland, after the war.</s>
 <s id="96">Udo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin.</s>
 <s id="97">He loves going to Argentina -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the economic corruption there.</s>
 <s id="98">Where is Udo from?</s>
 <s id="99">With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin.</s>
 <s id="100">That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history.</s>
 <s id="101">That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life.</s>
 <s id="102">Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.</s>
 <s id="103">He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one.</s>
 <s id="104">To claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends.</s>
 <s id="105">Meanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay.</s>
 <s id="106">Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur.</s>
 <s id="107">To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience.</s>
 <s id="108">Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.</s>
 <s id="109">Of course, when we ask, "Where are you from?"</s>
 <s id="110">we're using a kind of shorthand.</s>
 <s id="111">It's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin," and as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood.</s>
 <s id="112">But that's not quite the point.</s>
 <s id="113">The difference between "Where are you from?"</s>
 <s id="114">and "Where are you a local?"</s>
 <s id="115">isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question.</s>
 <s id="116">Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs.</s>
 <s id="117">Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players.</s>
 <s id="118">As a unit of measurement for human experience, the country doesn't quite work.</s>
 <s id="119">That's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria."</s>
 <s id="120">The "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.</s>
 <s id="121">"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed.</s>
 <s id="122">You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience.</s>
 <s id="123">That I carry within me.</s>
 <s id="124">Where I'm from comes wherever I go.</s>
 <s id="125">To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.</s>
 <s id="126">There's much to be said for national history, more for the sovereign state.</s>
 <s id="127">Culture exists in community, and community exists in context.</s>
 <s id="128">Geography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important.</s>
 <s id="129">What I'm questioning is primacy.</s>
 <s id="130">All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.</s>
 <s id="131">What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?</s>
 <s id="132">And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?</s>
 <s id="133">Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power.</s>
 <p id="p134">
  <s id="134.1">"Where are you from?"</s>
  <s id="134.2">Mexico.</s>
  <s id="134.3">Poland.</s>
  <s id="134.4">Bangladesh.</s>
  <s id="134.5">Less power.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p135">
  <s id="135.1">America.</s>
  <s id="135.2">Germany.</s>
  <s id="135.3">Japan.</s>
  <s id="135.4">More power.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p136">
  <s id="136.1">China.</s>
  <s id="136.2">Russia.</s>
  <s id="136.3">Ambiguous.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="137">(Laughter) It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game, especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.</s>
 <s id="138">As any recent immigrant knows, the question "Where are you from?" or "Where are you really from?"</s>
 <s id="139">is often code for "Why are you here?"</s>
 <s id="140">Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges.</s>
 <s id="141">"Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan -- never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers."</s>
 <s id="142">I'm with him.</s>
 <s id="143">To call one student American, another Pakistani, then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.</s>
 <s id="144">The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.</s>
 <s id="145">A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies.</s>
 <s id="146">Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them.</s>
 <s id="147">I'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana.</s>
 <s id="148">I go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana.</s>
 <s id="149">It's not because I wasn't born there.</s>
 <s id="150">My father can't go back, either.</s>
 <s id="151">The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists.</s>
 <s id="152">We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.</s>
 <s id="153">Something, somewhere will always have changed, most of all, ourselves.</s>
 <s id="154">People.</s>
 <s id="155">Finally, what we're talking about is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.</s>
 <s id="156">In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.</s>
 <s id="157">The more we know about where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human the characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less.</s>
 <s id="158">The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.</s>
 <s id="159">In fact, all of us are multi -- multi-local, multi-layered.</s>
 <s id="160">To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think, not further apart.</s>
 <s id="161">So the next time that I'm introduced, I'd love to hear the truth: "Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here.</s>
 <s id="162">She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.</s>
 <s id="163">She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra."</s>
 <s id="164">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="165">(Applause)</s>
