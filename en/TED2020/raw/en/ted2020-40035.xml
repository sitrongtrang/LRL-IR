 <s id="1">On April 26th, 1937, Fascist forces bombed the Basque village of Guernica in Northern Spain.</s>
 <s id="2">It was one of the worst civilian casualties of the Spanish Civil War, waged between the democratic republic and General Franco’s fascist contingent.</s>
 <s id="3">For Pablo Picasso, the tragedy sparked a frenzied period of work in which he produced a massive anti-war mural, aptly titled "Guernica."</s>
 <s id="4">The painting is a powerful work of historical documentation and political protest.</s>
 <s id="5">But while Picasso’s artistic motivations are clear, the symbolism of the painting can be as confusing and chaotic as war itself.</s>
 <s id="6">How can we make sense of this overwhelming image, and what exactly makes it a masterpiece of anti-war art?</s>
 <s id="7">The painting’s monumental canvas is disorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style Picasso pioneered.</s>
 <s id="8">Cubism deliberately emphasized the two-dimensionality of the canvas by flattening the objects being painted.</s>
 <s id="9">This afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives on the same object; a technique considered shocking even in Picasso’s domestic scenes.</s>
 <s id="10">But in this context, the style offers a profoundly overwhelming view of violence, destruction, and casualties.</s>
 <s id="11">Multiple perspectives only compound the horror on display– sending the eyes hurtling around the frame in a futile hunt for peace.</s>
 <s id="12">On the far left, a woman holding her dead child releases a scream; her eyes sliding down her face in the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally to echo her baby’s.</s>
 <s id="13">There is the statue of a soldier present below, but he is unable to defend the woman and child.</s>
 <s id="14">Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword in a signal of utmost defeat.</s>
 <s id="15">The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot as she attempts to flee the devastation.</s>
 <s id="16">But her other leg appears rooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas even as she stretches to move it.</s>
 <s id="17">Another victim appears behind this slouching figure.</s>
 <s id="18">Falling helplessly as flames lick around her, she too is caught in her own hopeless scene.</s>
 <s id="19">Each of these figures bordering the painting are horribly trapped, giving the work an acute sense of claustrophobia.</s>
 <s id="20">And where you might expect the canvas’ massive size to counteract this feeling, its scale only highlights the nearly life-sized atrocities on display.</s>
 <s id="21">Some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman reaching out her window.</s>
 <s id="22">But is her lantern’s hopeful glow truly lighting the scene?</s>
 <s id="23">Or is it the jagged lightbulb– thought to represent the technologies of modern warfare– which illuminates her view of the chaos below?</s>
 <s id="24">From the coffin-like confines of her window, her arm guides the viewer back into the fray, to perhaps the most controversial symbols of all– two ghostly animals caught in the destruction.</s>
 <s id="25">Does the screaming horse embody the threat of Franco’s military nationalism; or does the spike running through its body convey its victimhood?</s>
 <s id="26">Does the white bull represent Spain, the country of matadors and a common theme in Picasso’s work– or does it stand for the brutality of war?</s>
 <s id="27">In this scene of strife, these animals raise more questions than answers.</s>
 <s id="28">And additional elements hidden throughout the frame offer even more secrets for close observers.</s>
 <s id="29">At the top of the canvas flashes a bird desperate to escape the carnage.</s>
 <s id="30">And the abundance of animals on display may hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and other potential causalities.</s>
 <s id="31">Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense with destruction.</s>
 <s id="32">But hidden beneath this supposed chaos, are carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted attack on fascism.</s>
 <s id="33">Decades after its creation, "Guernica" retains its power to shock viewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war gatherings around the world.</s>
 <s id="34">Hundreds of viewers have grappled with its harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging.</s>
 <s id="35">But even without a close understanding of it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder of the true casualties of violence.</s>
