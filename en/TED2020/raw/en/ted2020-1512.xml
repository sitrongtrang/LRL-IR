 <s id="1">Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness, so I've never seen color, and I don't know what color looks like, because I come from a grayscale world.</s>
 <s id="2">To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white.</s>
 <s id="3">But, since the age of 21, instead of seeing color, I can hear color.</s>
 <s id="4">In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona, is this electronic eye.</s>
 <s id="5">It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like — This is the sound of purple.</s>
  <s id="6.2">(Frequency sounds) For example, this is the sound of grass.</s>
  <s id="6.3">(Frequency sounds) This is red, like TED.</s>
  <s id="6.4">(Frequency sounds) This is the sound of a dirty sock.</s>
  <s id="6.5">(Laughter) Which is like yellow, this one.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time.</s>
 <s id="8">At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception.</s>
 <s id="9">I didn't have to think about the notes.</s>
 <s id="10">And after some time, this perception became a feeling.</s>
 <s id="11">I started to have favorite colors, and I started to dream in colors.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds.</s>
  <s id="12.2">It wasn't the software, so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.</s>
 <s id="14">It had become a part of my body, an extension of my senses, and after some time, it even became a part of my official image.</s>
 <s id="15">This is my passport from 2004.</s>
 <s id="16">You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports with electronic equipment, but I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing was actually a new part of my body, an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me to appear with the passport photo.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color, because color is almost everywhere, so the biggest change for example is going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso, for example.</s>
  <s id="17.2">So it's like I'm going to a concert hall, because I can listen to the paintings.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking, it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.</s>
 <s id="19">It's like going to a nightclub.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">It's full of different melodies.</s>
  <s id="20.2">(Laughter) Yeah.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">Especially the aisle with cleaning products.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">It's just fabulous.</s>
  <s id="22.2">(Laughter) Also, the way I dress has changed.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.</s>
  <s id="24.2">(Laughter) (Applause) So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.</s>
  <s id="24.3">(Laughter) If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange.</s>
  <s id="24.4">(Laughter) Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song.</s>
  <s id="24.5">(Laughter) So depending on how I display it, I can hear and I can compose music with food.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like, Lady Gaga salads as starters.</s>
  <s id="25.2">(Laughter) I mean, this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts, that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs.</s>
 <s id="27">Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed, because when I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite, the other way around.</s>
  <s id="28.2">So I really enjoy creating, like, sound portraits of people.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.</s>
 <s id="30">Here's some faces.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">(Musical chords) Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good.</s>
  <s id="31.2">(Laughter) Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.</s>
 <s id="33">They have similar sound of eyes.</s>
 <s id="34">So you relate people that you wouldn't relate, and you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces.</s>
 <s id="35">So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.</s>
 <s id="36">The good thing about this is, if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.</s>
 <s id="37">It's not my fault, because — (Laughter) And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color.</s>
 <s id="38">I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green.</s>
 <s id="39">The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise, and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience, so I started to paint music and paint people's voices, because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color.</s>
 <s id="40">And here's some music translated into color.</s>
 <s id="41">For example, Mozart, "Queen of the Night," looks like this.</s>
 <s id="42">(Music) Very yellow and very colorful, because there's many different frequencies.</s>
 <s id="43">(Music) And this is a completely different song.</s>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">(Music) It's Justin Bieber's "Baby."</s>
  <s id="44.2">(Laughter) (Music) It is very pink and very yellow.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color, for example, these are two very well-known speeches.</s>
 <s id="46">One of them is Martin Luther King's "I Have A Dream," and the other one is Hitler.</s>
 <s id="47">And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels, and then I ask people, "Which one do you prefer?"</s>
 <s id="48">And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.</s>
 <s id="49">So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors, just like human vision.</s>
 <s id="50">I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.</s>
 <s id="51">But then, I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough.</s>
 <s id="52">There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but that electronic eyes can perceive.</s>
 <s id="53">So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive.</s>
 <s id="54">For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.</s>
 <s id="55">I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.</s>
 <s id="56">And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe, because ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive.</s>
 <s id="57">That's why, two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body.</s>
 <s id="58">We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses, so if we extend our senses, we will consequently extend our knowledge.</s>
 <s id="59">I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body.</s>
 <s id="60">I think this will be a big, big change that we will see during this century.</s>
 <s id="61">So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend.</s>
 <s id="62">I would encourage you to become a cyborg.</s>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">You won't be alone.</s>
  <s id="63.2">Thank you.</s>
  <s id="63.3">(Applause) (Applause)</s>
