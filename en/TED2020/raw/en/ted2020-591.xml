 <s id="1">Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz.</s>
 <s id="2">And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists.</s>
 <s id="3">David Sibbet from The Grove, and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk, made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter's ideas.</s>
 <s id="4">And the consensus was: it really worked.</s>
 <s id="5">These sketches brought to life the key ideas, the portraits, the magic moments that we all experienced last year.</s>
 <s id="6">This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"</s>
 <s id="7">What is it about animation, graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?</s>
 <s id="8">And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning, the better we can communicate, and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.</s>
 <s id="9">So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes.</s>
 <s id="10">Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is, but instead, creates a series of mental models through a collection of "Ah-ha moments," or moments of discovery, through various processes.</s>
 <s id="11">The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.</s>
 <s id="12">Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated, most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain, at the primary visual cortex.</s>
 <s id="13">And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry, just the simplest of shapes.</s>
 <s id="14">But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain.</s>
 <s id="15">As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense, create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.</s>
 <s id="16">We're only going to talk about three of them.</s>
 <s id="17">So the first one is called the ventral stream.</s>
 <s id="18">It's on this side of the brain.</s>
 <s id="19">And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.</s>
 <s id="20">It's the "what" detector.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">Look at a hand.</s>
  <s id="21.2">Look at a remote control.</s>
  <s id="21.3">Chair.</s>
  <s id="21.4">Book.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something.</s>
 <s id="23">A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.</s>
 <s id="24">And what it does is locates the object in physical body space.</s>
 <s id="25">So if you look around the stage here you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.</s>
 <s id="26">And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.</s>
 <s id="27">You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.</s>
 <s id="28">The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">And this is deep inside of the brain.</s>
  <s id="29.2">It's very old, evolutionarily.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">And it's the part that feels.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image and you go, "Oh!</s>
  <s id="31.2">I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">So what can we learn about this?</s>
  <s id="33.2">How can we apply this insight?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">Well, again, the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.</s>
 <s id="35">The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model.</s>
 <s id="36">So, for example, when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around, to selectively create a visual logic.</s>
 <s id="37">So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.</s>
 <s id="38">It's the selective logic.</s>
 <s id="39">Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.</s>
 <s id="40">Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall.</s>
 <s id="41">And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.</s>
 <s id="42">So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning.</s>
 <s id="43">It activates a different part of the brain.</s>
 <s id="44">And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion, when we see color, and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we've heard about before.</s>
 <s id="45">So the point of this is what?</s>
 <s id="46">We make meaning by seeing, by an act of visual interrogation.</s>
 <s id="47">The lessons for us are three-fold.</s>
 <s id="48">First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.</s>
 <s id="49">Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully.</s>
 <s id="50">And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence.</s>
 <s id="51">These are techniques that can be used to be -- that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.</s>
 <s id="52">So the low-tech version looks like this.</s>
 <s id="53">And, by the way, this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk, in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.</s>
 <s id="54">What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall.</s>
 <s id="55">And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.</s>
 <s id="56">There's always a room, always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan.</s>
 <s id="57">This is a time-lapse view of it.</s>
 <s id="58">You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">You'll be able to figure that out.</s>
  <s id="59.2">(Laughter) So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">No Powerpoint is used in two days.</s>
 <s id="61">But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on.</s>
 <s id="62">And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology.</s>
 <s id="63">And this is our great unveiling for today.</s>
 <s id="64">And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible.</s>
 <s id="65">Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.</s>
 <s id="66">So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen.</s>
 <s id="67">So making images meaningful has three components.</s>
 <s id="68">The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.</s>
 <s id="69">Secondly, making them interactive.</s>
 <s id="70">And then thirdly, making them persistent.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today.</s>
  <s id="71.2">Thanks so much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">(Applause)</s>
