 <s id="1">It's story time.</s>
 <s id="2">Settle back, and I'll begin.</s>
 <s id="3">Once upon a time, a mother duck sat patiently on her nest of eggs, waiting for them to hatch.</s>
 <s id="4">And then one day, she felt something move beneath her.</s>
 <s id="5">Crack, crack!</s>
 <s id="6">Filled with happiness, she watched as her eggs hatched one by one.</s>
 <s id="7">I don't know about you, but when I was little, story time was always one of my favorite parts of the day.</s>
 <s id="8">And I loved reading to my two sons when they were small, too.</s>
 <s id="9">It's that special time when a parent and child can be totally absorbed together in mystical kingdoms, fantastical beasties or scruffy little ducks that turn out to be swans.</s>
 <s id="10">Well, that's how it is for some children, but for other children, there isn't a parent around to read to them.</s>
 <s id="11">I'd like to tell you about Sophie.</s>
 <s id="12">Sophie's five years old and lives with her parents.</s>
 <s id="13">One day, there's a bang at the door.</s>
 <s id="14">Sophie hears lots of shouting; her mum's crying.</s>
 <s id="15">She sees the police dragging her father away.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">Sophie's afraid.</s>
  <s id="16.2">She starts crying, too.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">Weeks go by.</s>
 <s id="18">Sophie doesn't know what's happened to her dad.</s>
 <s id="19">When she asks her mum, her mum gets upset.</s>
 <s id="20">So she stops asking.</s>
 <s id="21">Sophie waits.</s>
 <s id="22">She really misses her dad.</s>
 <s id="23">Every day, she hurries home from school, in case he's come back.</s>
 <s id="24">On many nights, she cries herself to sleep.</s>
 <s id="25">Children at school start to tease her.</s>
 <s id="26">They call her names.</s>
 <s id="27">Somebody's mum has heard that Sophie's dad is in prison.</s>
 <s id="28">Sophie pretends to be ill so she doesn't have to go to school.</s>
 <s id="29">And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind with her schoolwork.</s>
 <s id="30">After what seems a long, long time to Sophie, a letter arrives.</s>
 <s id="31">It's from her dad.</s>
 <s id="32">The writing is very messy.</s>
 <s id="33">The letter makes her mum cry, but she reads a little out to Sophie.</s>
 <s id="34">He says that he's OK and that he's missing them.</s>
 <s id="35">It's a short letter.</s>
 <s id="36">Sophie says she'd like to go and see her dad, wherever he is.</s>
 <s id="37">But her mum says it's too far away, and they can't afford the journey.</s>
 <s id="38">Then one day the phone rings.</s>
 <s id="39">"Sophie, come speak to daddy."</s>
 <s id="40">Dad sounds different, far away.</s>
 <s id="41">He says he can't talk for very long, and anyway, it's very noisy wherever he is.</s>
 <s id="42">And Sophie doesn't know what to say to him.</s>
 <s id="43">Well, as stories go, that's not a very nice one.</s>
 <s id="44">In the United Kingdom, 200,000 children experience the shame and isolation of a parent in prison.</s>
 <s id="45">Two hundred thousand.</s>
 <s id="46">That's more than the number of children each year who are affected by their parents divorcing.</s>
 <s id="47">And it can affect the children of prisoners very deeply.</s>
 <s id="48">There can be problems at school, and they're three times more likely to suffer from mental health issues.</s>
 <s id="49">In so many ways, children are the unintended victims of their parents' crimes.</s>
 <s id="50">In so many ways, children are the overlooked victims of their parents' crimes.</s>
 <s id="51">Until last November, I was a serving prisoner, imprisoned for fraud.</s>
 <s id="52">I was dishonest, and I paid the penalty.</s>
 <s id="53">Before that, I'd been a practicing solicitor for 30 years.</s>
 <s id="54">I'd had a happy and stable upbringing, a good education, a happy marriage, which, I'm pleased to say, continues.</s>
 <s id="55">I have two adult sons.</s>
 <s id="56">When they were growing up, I did my best to be around for them as much as I could.</s>
 <s id="57">And I took a careful interest in what they did.</s>
 <s id="58">I read to my boys every night, and ironically, our favorite story was "Burglar Bill."</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) But when I got to prison, it soon became apparent that my background was very different to that of most of the prisoners.</s>
 <s id="60">Few of the men that I met had had a decent education.</s>
 <s id="61">Indeed, many associated education with humiliation and failure.</s>
 <s id="62">I can tell you firsthand that prison is dehumanizing.</s>
 <s id="63">Prisoners harden up, they shut down, they close in ...</s>
 <s id="64">just to survive.</s>
 <s id="65">And this can be devastating for families.</s>
 <s id="66">In fact, maintaining contact with your family from prison can be very difficult indeed.</s>
 <s id="67">And if a child does get to see their parent in prison, they have to go through the same pat-down searches as the adults.</s>
 <s id="68">They walk through the same detector frames, they're sniffed by the same sniffer dogs, and all because some children have been the unwitting carriers of drugs and mobile phones.</s>
 <s id="69">And when they get through to see their parent, they may be tired from a long journey, shy, tongue-tied, even upset.</s>
 <s id="70">And it isn't easy for the parents, who may not be getting along.</s>
 <s id="71">For many reasons, not just these, over half of prisoners lose contact with their children and families.</s>
 <s id="72">How can we help prisoners to stay in contact with their families?</s>
 <s id="73">When I was a prisoner at Channings Wood Prison, I began working for a charity called Storybook Dads.</s>
 <s id="74">Storybook Dads began in 2003, when Sharon Berry, a civilian worker in a prison, realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children.</s>
 <s id="75">And so, armed with a few storybooks, she began to help prisoners to read and record stories to send home to their children.</s>
 <p id="p76">
  <s id="76.1">It wasn't a new idea.</s>
  <s id="76.2">Few ideas like this are new.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="77">They're great ideas.</s>
 <s id="78">But it was an instant success.</s>
 <s id="79">You may wonder: How does the recording of the stories work in prison?</s>
 <s id="80">Is it difficult for prisoners?</s>
 <s id="81">Can it be challenging?</s>
 <s id="82">Well, the process of choosing, reading and recording a story can be very challenging for prisoners.</s>
 <s id="83">Prison is tough, and prisoners can't afford to show any signs of weakness or vulnerability.</s>
 <s id="84">But this, this recording process, this can be uncomfortable, upsetting, sometimes all just a bit too much.</s>
 <s id="85">And prisoners often cry.</s>
 <s id="86">They cry because they regret missing out on their children's lives.</s>
 <s id="87">They cry because they're ashamed that they've let their families down.</s>
 <s id="88">They cry because they don't know how to go about reading to their children.</s>
 <s id="89">But because when they come to us we offer a private space, one-to-one, prisoners don't need to be tough anymore, and they can use their vulnerability as a strength when contacting with their children.</s>
 <s id="90">I remember one prisoner who came to record.</s>
 <s id="91">He was a big, hard man with a reputation for being tough.</s>
 <s id="92">He came along as implacable as ever.</s>
 <s id="93">But when the door of the recording room closed behind him, that facade began to crumble.</s>
 <s id="94">From his pocket, he took a screwed-up piece of paper and quietly began to read the words which he'd written as a message for his two little ones.</s>
 <s id="95">His hands were shaking.</s>
 <s id="96">And then, in a surprisingly quiet voice, he began to sing their favorite lullaby.</s>
 <s id="97">You see, there wasn't much that he could do from behind bars to show his children that he missed and loved them.</s>
 <s id="98">But he could do this.</s>
 <s id="99">Once the recording is made, it's sent to the Storybook Dads production unit at Channings Wood Prison in Devon.</s>
 <s id="100">And that's where I worked.</s>
 <s id="101">I was trained, along with other prisoners, to edit and produce recordings sent in from prisons all over the United Kingdom.</s>
 <s id="102">Using audio and video software, the recordings have the mistakes taken out and sound effects and music added in.</s>
 <s id="103">And the experience and skill which the prison editors gain helps them in their future employment.</s>
 <s id="104">Once the recording is finalized, it's transferred to a CD or a DVD and sent out to the families so that the children can watch them whenever they feel the need.</s>
 <s id="105">And they listen to these recordings and watch them a lot -- at bedtime, in the car ...</s>
 <s id="106">Some even take them to school to show their friends.</s>
 <s id="107">These recordings, they show the children that they're loved and missed.</s>
 <s id="108">And they show the prisoner that they can do something for their child, as a parent.</s>
 <s id="109">Do you remember Sophie?</s>
 <s id="110">Well, one day, just before Christmas, a parcel arrived, and this is what was in it.</s>
 <s id="111">Let's listen to a little of it together.</s>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">(Video) Santa: On, Comet!</s>
  <s id="112.2">On, Cupid!</s>
  <s id="112.3">On, Donner and Blitzen!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">Charlie: That's his reindeer, isn't it?</s>
 <s id="114">Santa: It is his reindeer, yeah.</s>
 <s id="115">Up, up, higher and higher they flew, across land, across oceans they sped.</s>
 <s id="116">Through the magical northern lights they passed -- I'd love to see the northern lights, wouldn't you?</s>
 <s id="117">Charlie: I figure they'd probably look a bit like that snowman's belly.</s>
 <s id="118">Santa: They probably would, yeah.</s>
 <s id="119">That's a cool snowman, isn't it?</s>
 <s id="120">Charlie: It's very cool indeed, I love it.</s>
 <s id="121">Santa: They visited all the children in the world and left presents for each and every one.</s>
 <s id="122">In the blink of an eye, they were back in Frogsbottom Field.</s>
 <s id="123">(Charlie Laughs) Santa: You think that's well funny?</s>
 <s id="124">Charlie: I want to live in Frogsbottom Field!</s>
 <s id="125">Santa: Where do you live, in Frogsbottom Tree?</s>
 <s id="126">Charlie: I don't, I live in this tree.</s>
 <s id="127">I've made it all Christmasy-look.</s>
 <s id="128">Santa: It's nice, that.</s>
 <s id="129">You've done a good job, good job.</s>
 <s id="130">Charlie: Thank you very much!</s>
 <s id="131">(Laughter) Alan Crickmore: Sophie and her mum listened to that three times, and they haven't laughed so much in a long time.</s>
 <s id="132">They can see that he's all right, they can see that he loves them, and the next time he rings, Sophie's got plenty to talk about: "What does Charlie the Chimp eat?</s>
 <s id="133">Will daddy do another story very soon?"</s>
 <s id="134">Since it began in 2003, Storybook Dads has grown and grown.</s>
 <s id="135">It now operates as Storybook Dads and Storybook Mums in more than 100 prisons in the United Kingdom.</s>
 <s id="136">Ninety-eight percent of the prisoners who take part say that it's improved their relationship with their child.</s>
 <s id="137">And since 2003, over 60,000 DVDs and CDs have been sent out to the children of prisoners.</s>
 <s id="138">For Sophie's family and for thousands of families like them, Storybook Dads has been a lifeline.</s>
 <s id="139">Some prisoners say that it's the first time that they've begun to build a relationship with their child.</s>
 <s id="140">And some poor readers have been so inspired by what they've been able to achieve that they've gone to education classes to improve their own reading skills.</s>
 <s id="141">Let's go back to the story of "The Ugly Duckling."</s>
 <s id="142">But this time, I'd like to play you a recording made by a prisoner, because it encapsulates the power of what we do.</s>
 <s id="143">The prisoner was an Irish Traveller who couldn't read.</s>
 <s id="144">And he wanted to send a story home to his daughter for her birthday.</s>
 <s id="145">With the help of a mentor and some clever editing, something magical happened.</s>
 <s id="146">This is an extract from the raw recording, where the prisoner is reading the story by repeating it, phrase at a time.</s>
 <s id="147">(Audio) Mentor: He had nowhere to hide.</s>
 <s id="148">Owen: He had nowhere to hide.</s>
 <s id="149">Mentor: So one day, he ran away.</s>
 <s id="150">Owen: Then one day, he ran away.</s>
 <s id="151">Mentor: He ran until he came to the great marsh.</s>
 <s id="152">Owen: He run until he come to the great marsh.</s>
 <s id="153">Mentor: Where the wild ducks lived.</s>
 <s id="154">Owen: Where the wild ducks lived.</s>
 <s id="155">AC: And this is a recording -- an excerpt of the recording with the mentor's voice taken out and sound effects and music added in.</s>
 <s id="156">(Audio) Owen: He had nowhere to hide.</s>
 <s id="157">Then one day, he run away.</s>
 <s id="158">He run until he come to the great marsh where the wild ducks lived, and he laid in the rushes for two weeks.</s>
 <s id="159">(Music) (Ducks quack) Some wild ducks and geese come to look at him.</s>
 <s id="160">"You're very ugly," they said, and they laughed at him.</s>
 <s id="161">(Ducks quack) The ugly duckling ran away from the great marsh.</s>
 <s id="162">(Duck quacks) AC: And this is how he finished the story: (Audio) Owen: He wasn't an ugly duckling at all.</s>
 <s id="163">During the winter, he had grown into a beautiful white swan.</s>
 <s id="164">The other swans looked at him and thought how beautiful he was.</s>
 <s id="165">"Come with us," they said.</s>
 <s id="166">And he did.</s>
 <s id="167">(Bird sounds) Well, Tiara, I hope you have enjoyed this story as much as I enjoyed reading this story to you.</s>
 <s id="168">I cannot wait to be with you again and hold you in my arms.</s>
 <s id="169">All my love, your daddy, Owen.</s>
 <s id="170">Lots of love, I miss you with all my heart.</s>
 <p id="p171">
  <s id="171.1">Goodbye for now, my love.</s>
  <s id="171.2">Bye bye.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="172">(Music) (Music ends) AC: When he listened to that recording in his cell before it was sent out to his daughter, he cried.</s>
 <s id="173">And that's a pretty common reaction from prisoners, as they realize for the first time they've been able to do something for their child which they never thought they could.</s>
 <s id="174">They've connected in the most fundamental way, through the medium of storytelling.</s>
 <s id="175">And as for Sophie, she wants "The Gruffalo" next time.</s>
 <s id="176">(Laughter) (Applause)</s>
