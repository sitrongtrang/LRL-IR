 <s id="1">In January of 1953, a tidal surge shook the North Sea.</s>
 <s id="2">The titanic waves flooded the Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people.</s>
 <s id="3">54 years later, a similar storm threatened the region.</s>
 <s id="4">But this time, the Netherlands were ready.</s>
 <s id="5">As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors activated emergency protocols.</s>
 <s id="6">Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms swung shut, protecting the channel ahead.</s>
 <s id="7">Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm with the shifting wind and waves.</s>
 <s id="8">By morning, the storm had passed with minimal flooding.</s>
 <s id="9">The first field activation of the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success.</s>
 <s id="10">As one of the planet’s largest mobile structures, this storm surge barrier is a marvel of human engineering.</s>
 <s id="11">But the Maeslantkering is just one part of a massive, interlocking system of water controls known as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention project in the world.</s>
 <s id="12">The Netherlands has a long history with water management.</s>
 <s id="13">The country lies along the delta of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory is below sea level.</s>
 <s id="14">This geography makes the region extremely prone to flooding.</s>
 <s id="15">So much so, that some of the earliest Dutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that coordinated flood protection projects.</s>
 <s id="16">But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch government took more official measures.</s>
 <s id="17">They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting the entire southwestern region.</s>
 <s id="18">Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds of flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe as the average coastal city.</s>
 <s id="19">Accomplishing this lofty goal required various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast.</s>
 <s id="20">The first line of defense was to dam the region’s flood-prone estuaries.</s>
 <s id="21">These large inlets fed many of the country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed flood water to surge inland.</s>
 <s id="22">Using a series of dams, the Delta Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve as nature preserves and community parks.</s>
 <s id="23">However, this solution wouldn’t work for the Nieuwe Waterweg.</s>
 <s id="24">As the lifeblood of the local shipping industry, this passage had to be kept open in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges.</s>
 <s id="25">In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible protection necessary.</s>
 <s id="26">Alongside additional barriers, like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on holding back ocean storms.</s>
 <s id="27">But in the following decades, the Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works and protect against floods further inland.</s>
 <s id="28">Under the "Room for the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated away from the shore.</s>
 <s id="29">This left more space for water to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats for local wildlife.</s>
 <s id="30">This strategic retreat not only decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped settlements to be built more densely and sustainably.</s>
 <s id="31">Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city almost entirely below sea level.</s>
 <s id="32">When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts are protected by traditional dikes.</s>
 <s id="33">Meanwhile, newer districts have been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs that store rainwater.</s>
 <s id="34">Numerous structures around the city transform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters and sports arenas.</s>
 <s id="35">Meanwhile in the harbor, floating pavilions rise with the water level.</s>
 <s id="36">These are the first of several planned amphibious structures, some of which house water purification systems and solar collectors.</s>
 <s id="37">These strategies are just some of the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands at the cutting edge of water management.</s>
 <s id="38">The country continues to find new ways to make cities more resilient to natural disasters.</s>
 <s id="39">And as the rising sea levels caused by climate change threaten low-lying cities across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional example of how to go with the flow.</s>
