 <s id="1">In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner of the mahjong table.</s>
 <s id="2">At the north, south, and west corners are her aunties, long-time members of the Joy Luck Club.</s>
 <s id="3">This group of immigrant families comes together weekly to trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, and play mahjong.</s>
 <s id="4">However, the club’s founder, Jing-Mei’s mother Suyuan, has recently passed away.</s>
 <s id="5">At first, Jing-Mei struggles to fill her place at the table.</s>
 <s id="6">But when her aunties reveal a deeply buried secret about Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot to learn about her mother, and herself.</s>
 <s id="7">In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, "The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong table is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes.</s>
 <s id="8">The book itself is loosely structured to imitate the format of the Chinese game.</s>
 <s id="9">Just as mahjong is played over four rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four parts, each with four chapters.</s>
 <s id="10">Alternately set in China or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single story from one of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club or their American-born daughters.</s>
 <s id="11">These stories take the reader through war zones and villages of rural China, and into modern marriages and tense gatherings around the dinner table.</s>
 <s id="12">They touch upon themes of survival and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality.</s>
 <s id="13">In one, Auntie Lin plots an escape from the hostile family of her promised husband, ultimately leading to her arrival in America.</s>
 <s id="14">In another, the Hsu family’s all-American day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the responsibility her mother assigns to her.</s>
 <s id="15">The resulting tragedy traumatizes the family for years to come.</s>
 <s id="16">These tales illustrate the common divides that can form between generations and cultures, especially in immigrant families.</s>
 <s id="17">The mothers have all experienced great hardships during their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly to give their children better opportunities in America.</s>
 <s id="18">But their daughters feel weighed down by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high expectations.</s>
 <s id="19">Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays mahjong with her mother’s friends.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">She worries, “In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America.”</s>
  <s id="20.2">Time and again, the mothers strive to remind their daughters of their history and heritage.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">Meanwhile, their daughters struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them with who they really are.</s>
 <s id="22">"Does my daughter know me?" some of the stories ask.</s>
 <s id="23">"Why doesn’t my mother understand?" others respond.</s>
 <s id="24">In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to anxieties that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated from their homeland and disconnected from their adopted country.</s>
 <s id="25">But by weaving the tales of these four mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find strength to tackle their present-day problems through the values their mothers passed on to them.</s>
 <s id="26">When "The Joy Luck Club" was first published, Tan expected minimal success.</s>
 <s id="27">But against her predictions, the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement.</s>
 <s id="28">Today, these characters still captivate readers worldwide.</s>
 <s id="29">Not only for the way they speak to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper truth: the need to be seen and understood by the ones you love.</s>
