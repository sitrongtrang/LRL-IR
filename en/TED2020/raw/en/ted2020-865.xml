 <s id="1">I was here four years ago, and I remember, at the time, that the talks weren't put online.</s>
 <s id="2">I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">(Laughter) And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said, "We're going to start putting them online.</s>
  <s id="3.2">Can we put yours online?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">And I said, "Sure."</s>
 <s id="5">And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times.</s>
 <s id="6">So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it.</s>
 <s id="7">And, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) (Applause) Don't you feel?</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) So, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you, so here it is.</s>
 <s id="10">(Laughter) Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis.</s>
 <s id="11">And I referenced that at the end of my last talk.</s>
 <s id="12">So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) So, as I was saying -- (Laughter) You see, he's right.</s>
 <s id="14">I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) But I believe there is a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.</s>
 <s id="16">And you may say, by the way, "Look, I'm good.</s>
 <s id="17">I have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one."</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) But this is a crisis of, not natural resources -- though I believe that's true -- but a crisis of human resources.</s>
 <s id="19">I believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days, that we make very poor use of our talents.</s>
 <s id="20">Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any to speak of.</s>
 <s id="21">I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything.</s>
 <s id="22">Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.</s>
 <s id="23">Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument.</s>
 <s id="24">He said, "There are two types of people in this world: those who divide the world into two types and those who do not."</s>
 <s id="25">(Laughter) Well, I do.</s>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.</s>
 <s id="27">They simply go through their lives getting on with it.</s>
 <s id="28">They get no great pleasure from what they do.</s>
 <s id="29">They endure it rather than enjoy it, and wait for the weekend.</s>
 <s id="30">But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.</s>
 <s id="31">If you said, "Don't do this anymore," they'd wonder what you're talking about.</s>
 <s id="32">It isn't what they do, it's who they are.</s>
 <s id="33">They say, "But this is me, you know.</s>
 <s id="34">It would be foolish to abandon this, because it speaks to my most authentic self."</s>
 <s id="35">And it's not true of enough people.</s>
 <s id="36">In fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.</s>
 <s id="37">And I think there are many possible explanations for it.</s>
 <s id="38">And high among them is education, because education, in a way, dislocates very many people from their natural talents.</s>
 <s id="39">And human resources are like natural resources; they're often buried deep.</s>
 <s id="40">You have to go looking for them, they're not just lying around on the surface.</s>
 <s id="41">You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.</s>
 <s id="42">And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often, it's not.</s>
 <s id="43">Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough.</s>
 <s id="44">Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply improving a broken model.</s>
 <s id="45">What we need -- and the word's been used many times in the past few days -- is not evolution, but a revolution in education.</s>
 <s id="46">This has to be transformed into something else.</s>
 <s id="47">(Applause) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education.</s>
 <s id="48">Innovation is hard, because it means doing something that people don't find very easy, for the most part.</s>
 <s id="49">It means challenging what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious.</s>
 <s id="50">The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense.</s>
 <s id="51">Things that people think, "It can't be done differently, that's how it's done."</s>
 <s id="52">I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln, who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point.</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress.</s>
 <s id="54">I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.</s>
 <s id="55">We don't teach American history in Britain.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">(Laughter) We suppress it.</s>
  <s id="56.2">You know, this is our policy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">(Laughter) No doubt, something fascinating was happening then, which the Americans among us will be aware of.</s>
 <s id="58">But he said this: "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.</s>
 <s id="59">The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion."</s>
 <s id="60">I love that.</s>
 <s id="61">Not rise to it, rise with it.</s>
 <s id="62">"As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.</s>
 <s id="63">We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country."</s>
 <s id="64">I love that word, "disenthrall."</s>
 <s id="65">You know what it means?</s>
 <s id="66">That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to, which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things, the way things are.</s>
 <s id="67">And many of our ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.</s>
 <s id="68">But our minds are still hypnotized by them, and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.</s>
 <s id="69">Now, doing this is easier said than done.</s>
 <s id="70">It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.</s>
 <s id="71">And the reason is that you take it for granted.</s>
 <s id="72">(Laughter) Let me ask you something you may take for granted.</s>
 <s id="73">How many of you here are over the age of 25?</s>
 <s id="74">That's not what you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that.</s>
 <s id="75">Are there any people here under the age of 25?</s>
 <p id="p76">
  <s id="76.1">Great.</s>
  <s id="76.2">Now, those over 25, could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="77">Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?</s>
 <s id="78">Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing.</s>
 <s id="79">Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.</s>
 <s id="80">I don't mean they can't, they just often choose not to.</s>
 <s id="81">And the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture, those of us over 25.</s>
 <s id="82">And so for us, if you want to know the time, you have to wear something to tell it.</s>
 <s id="83">Kids now live in a world which is digitized, and the time, for them, is everywhere.</s>
 <s id="84">They see no reason to do this.</s>
 <s id="85">And by the way, you don't need either; it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.</s>
 <s id="86">My daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.</s>
 <s id="87">She doesn't see the point.</s>
 <s id="88">As she says, "It's a single-function device."</s>
 <s id="89">(Laughter) "Like, how lame is that?"</s>
 <s id="90">And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."</s>
 <s id="91">(Laughter) "It has multiple functions."</s>
 <s id="92">(Laughter) But, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education.</s>
 <s id="93">A couple of examples.</s>
 <s id="94">One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.</s>
 <s id="95">Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic.</s>
 <s id="96">We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.</s>
 <s id="97">But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.</s>
 <s id="98">And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college.</s>
 <s id="99">I think we are obsessed with getting people to college.</s>
 <s id="100">Certain sorts of college.</s>
 <s id="101">I don't mean you shouldn't go, but not everybody needs to go, or go now.</s>
 <s id="102">Maybe they go later, not right away.</s>
 <s id="103">And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing.</s>
 <s id="104">There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.</s>
 <s id="105">I said, "What do you do?"</s>
 <s id="106">And he said, "I'm a fireman."</s>
 <s id="107">I asked, "How long have you been a fireman?"</s>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">"Always.</s>
  <s id="108.2">I've always been a fireman."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">"Well, when did you decide?"</s>
  <s id="109.2">He said, "As a kid.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">Actually, it was a problem for me at school, because at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."</s>
 <s id="111">(Laughter) He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."</s>
 <s id="112">And he said, "When I got to the senior year of school, my teachers didn't take it seriously.</s>
 <s id="113">This one teacher didn't take it seriously.</s>
 <s id="114">He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it; that I should go to college, I should become a professional person, that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that."</s>
 <s id="115">He said, "It was humiliating.</s>
 <s id="116">It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful.</s>
 <s id="117">But it's what I wanted, and as soon as I left school, I applied to the fire service and I was accepted.</s>
 <s id="118">You know, I was thinking about that guy recently, just a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher, because six months ago, I saved his life."</s>
 <s id="119">(Laughter) He said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I saved his wife's life as well."</s>
 <s id="120">He said, "I think he thinks better of me now."</s>
 <s id="121">(Laughter) (Applause) You know, to me, human communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability.</s>
 <s id="122">And at the heart of our challenges -- (Applause) At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.</s>
 <s id="123">This linearity thing is a problem.</s>
 <s id="124">When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten."</s>
 <s id="125">No, it doesn't.</s>
 <s id="126">(Laughter) It doesn't.</s>
 <s id="127">If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.</s>
 <s id="128">(Laughter) Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.</s>
 <s id="129">(Laughter) A friend of mine once said, "A three year-old is not half a six year-old."</s>
 <s id="130">(Laughter) (Applause) They're three.</s>
 <s id="131">But as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three.</s>
 <s id="132">Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels, you know, with their resumes -- (Laughter) Flicking through and saying, "What, this is it?"</s>
 <s id="133">(Laughter) (Applause) "You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?"</s>
 <s id="134">(Laughter) "You've achieved nothing -- commit.</s>
 <s id="135">(Laughter) Spent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see."</s>
 <s id="136">(Laughter) See, it's outrageous as a conception.</s>
 <s id="137">The other big issue is conformity.</s>
 <s id="138">We have built our education systems on the model of fast food.</s>
 <s id="139">This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day.</s>
 <s id="140">There are two models of quality assurance in catering.</s>
 <s id="141">One is fast food, where everything is standardized.</s>
 <s id="142">The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances.</s>
 <s id="143">And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.</s>
 <s id="144">(Applause) We have to recognize a couple of things here.</s>
 <s id="145">One is that human talent is tremendously diverse.</s>
 <s id="146">People have very different aptitudes.</s>
 <s id="147">I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.</s>
 <s id="148">(Laughter) It worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying.</s>
 <s id="149">(Laughter) In a way -- it did not for me.</s>
 <s id="150">I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it.</s>
 <s id="151">It just wouldn't work.</s>
 <s id="152">(Laughter) But it's not only about that.</s>
 <s id="153">It's about passion.</s>
 <s id="154">Often, people are good at things they don't really care for.</s>
 <s id="155">It's about passion, and what excites our spirit and our energy.</s>
 <s id="156">And if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at, time takes a different course entirely.</s>
 <s id="157">My wife's just finished writing a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end.</s>
 <s id="158">You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes.</s>
 <s id="159">If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour.</s>
 <s id="160">And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion.</s>
 <s id="161">So I think we have to change metaphors.</s>
 <s id="162">We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.</s>
 <s id="163">We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.</s>
 <s id="164">We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process.</s>
 <s id="165">And you cannot predict the outcome of human development.</s>
 <s id="166">All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.</s>
 <s id="167">So when we look at reforming education and transforming it, it isn't like cloning a system.</s>
 <s id="168">There are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.</s>
 <s id="169">There are many great models.</s>
 <s id="170">It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching.</s>
 <s id="171">And doing that, I think, is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution; it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions, but with external support based on a personalized curriculum.</s>
 <s id="172">Now in this room, there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business, in multimedia, in the Internet.</s>
 <s id="173">These technologies, combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education.</s>
 <s id="174">And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children.</s>
 <s id="175">But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model, where each school can be flourishing tomorrow.</s>
 <s id="176">That's where children experience life.</s>
 <s id="177">Or at home, if that's what they choose, to be educated with their families or friends.</s>
 <s id="178">There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days.</s>
 <s id="179">And I wanted to just very quickly -- I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night, recovering old poems.</s>
 <s id="180">I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem from W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know.</s>
 <s id="181">He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.</s>
 <s id="182">And he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."</s>
 <s id="183">He says this: "Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with gold and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams."</s>
 <s id="184">And every day, everywhere, our children spread their dreams beneath our feet.</s>
 <s id="185">And we should tread softly.</s>
 <s id="186">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="187">(Applause) Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="188">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="189">(Applause)</s>
