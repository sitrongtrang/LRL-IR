 <s id="1">How many times can you fold a piece of paper?</s>
 <s id="2">Assume that one had a piece of paper that was very fine, like the kind they typically use to print the Bible.</s>
 <s id="3">In reality, it seems like a piece of silk.</s>
 <s id="4">To qualify these ideas, let's say you have a paper that's one-thousandth of a centimeter in thickness.</s>
 <s id="5">That is 10 to the power of minus three centimeters, which equals .001 centimeters.</s>
 <s id="6">Let's also assume that you have a big piece of paper, like a page out of the newspaper.</s>
 <s id="7">Now we begin to fold it in half.</s>
 <s id="8">How many times do you think it could be folded like that?</s>
 <s id="9">And another question: If you could fold the paper over and over, as many times as you wish, say 30 times, what would you imagine the thickness of the paper would be then?</s>
 <s id="10">Before you move on, I encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question.</s>
 <s id="11">OK.</s>
 <s id="12">After we have folded the paper once, it is now two thousandths of a centimeter in thickness.</s>
 <s id="13">If we fold it in half once again, the paper will become four thousandths of a centimeter.</s>
 <s id="14">With every fold we make, the paper doubles in thickness.</s>
 <s id="15">And if we continue to fold it again and again, always in half, we would confront the following situation after 10 folds.</s>
 <s id="16">Two to the power of 10, meaning that you multiply two by itself 10 times, is one thousand and 24 thousandths of a centimeter, which is a little bit over one centimeter.</s>
 <s id="17">Assume we continue folding the paper in half.</s>
 <s id="18">What will happen then?</s>
 <s id="19">If we fold it 17 times, we'll get a thickness of two to the power of 17, which is 131 centimeters, and that equals just over four feet.</s>
 <s id="20">If we were able to fold it 25 times, then we would get two to the power of 25, which is 33,554 centimeters, just over 1,100 feet.</s>
 <s id="21">That would make it almost as tall as the Empire State Building.</s>
 <s id="22">It's worthwhile to stop here and reflect for a moment.</s>
 <s id="23">Folding a paper in half, even a paper as fine as that of the Bible, 25 times would give us a paper almost a quarter of a mile.</s>
 <s id="24">What do we learn?</s>
 <s id="25">This type of growth is called exponential growth, and as you see, just by folding a paper we can go very far, but very fast too.</s>
 <s id="26">Summarizing, if we fold a paper 25 times, the thickness is almost a quarter of a mile.</s>
 <s id="27">30 times, the thickness reaches 6.5 miles, which is about the average height that planes fly.</s>
 <s id="28">40 times, the thickness is nearly 7,000 miles, or the average GPS satellite's orbit.</s>
 <s id="29">48 times, the thickness is way over one million miles.</s>
 <s id="30">Now, if you think that the distance between the Earth and the Moon is less than 250,000 miles, then starting with a piece of Bible paper and folding it 45 times, we get to the Moon.</s>
 <s id="31">And if we double it one more time, we get back to Earth.</s>
