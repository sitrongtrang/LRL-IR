 <s id="1">Whether it’s being chained to a burning wheel, turned into a spider, or having an eagle eat one’s liver, Greek mythology is filled with stories of the gods inflicting gruesome horrors on mortals who angered them.</s>
 <s id="2">Yet one of their most famous punishments is not remembered for its outrageous cruelty, but for its disturbing familiarity.</s>
 <s id="3">Sisyphus was the first king of Ephyra, now known as Corinth.</s>
 <s id="4">Although a clever ruler who made his city prosperous, he was also a devious tyrant who seduced his niece and killed visitors to show off his power.</s>
 <s id="5">This violation of the sacred hospitality tradition greatly angered the gods.</s>
 <s id="6">But Sisyphus may still have avoided punishment if it hadn’t been for his reckless confidence.</s>
 <s id="7">The trouble began when Zeus kidnapped the nymph Aegina, carrying her away in the form of a massive eagle.</s>
 <s id="8">Aegina’s father, the river god Asopus, pursued their trail to Ephyra, where he encountered Sisyphus.</s>
 <s id="9">In exchange for the god making a spring inside the city, the king told Asopus which way Zeus had taken the girl.</s>
 <s id="10">When Zeus found out, he was so furious that he ordered Thanatos, or Death, to chain Sisyphus in the underworld so he couldn’t cause any more problems.</s>
 <s id="11">But Sisyphus lived up to his crafty reputation.</s>
 <s id="12">As he was about to be imprisoned, the king asked Thanatos to show him how the chains worked – and quickly bound him instead, before escaping back among the living.</s>
 <s id="13">With Thanatos trapped, no one could die, and the world was thrown into chaos.</s>
 <s id="14">Things only returned to normal when the god of war Ares, upset that battles were no longer fun, freed Thanatos from his chains.</s>
 <s id="15">Sisyphus knew his reckoning was at hand.</s>
 <s id="16">But he had another trick up his sleeve.</s>
 <s id="17">Before dying, he asked his wife Merope to throw his body in the public square, from where it eventually washed up on the shores of the river Styx.</s>
 <s id="18">Now back among the dead, Sisyphus approached Persephone, queen of the Underworld, and complained that his wife had disrespected him by not giving him a proper burial.</s>
 <s id="19">Persephone granted him permission to go back to the land of living and punish Merope, on the condition that he would return when he was done.</s>
 <s id="20">Of course, Sisyphus refused to keep his promise, now having twice escaped death by tricking the gods.</s>
 <s id="21">There wouldn’t be a third time, as the messenger Hermes dragged Sisyphus back to Hades.</s>
 <s id="22">The king had thought he was more clever than the gods, but Zeus would have the last laugh.</s>
 <s id="23">Sisyphus’s punishment was a straightforward task – rolling a massive boulder up a hill.</s>
 <s id="24">But just as he approached the top, the rock would roll all the way back down, forcing him to start over …and over, and over, for all eternity.</s>
 <s id="25">Historians have suggested that the tale of Sisyphus may stem from ancient myths about the rising and setting sun, or other natural cycles.</s>
 <s id="26">But the vivid image of someone condemned to endlessly repeat a futile task has resonated as an allegory about the human condition.</s>
 <s id="27">In his classic essay The Myth of Sisyphus, existentialist philosopher Albert Camus compared the punishment to humanity’s futile search for meaning and truth in a meaningless and indifferent universe.</s>
 <s id="28">Instead of despairing, Camus imagined Sisyphus defiantly meeting his fate as he walks down the hill to begin rolling the rock again.</s>
 <s id="29">And even if the daily struggles of our lives sometimes seem equally repetitive and absurd, we still give them significance and value by embracing them as our own.</s>
