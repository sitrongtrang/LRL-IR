 <s id="1">In the 16th century, Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea and blowing air to inflate its lungs.</s>
 <s id="2">In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant much acclaim.</s>
 <s id="3">But today, Vesalius’s treatise is recognized as the first description of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine.</s>
 <s id="4">To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how the respiratory system works.</s>
 <s id="5">We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, which expands our chest cavities.</s>
 <s id="6">This allows air to be drawn in, inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs.</s>
 <s id="7">Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries.</s>
 <s id="8">This blood absorbs oxygen from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide.</s>
 <s id="9">When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside a mix of oxygen and other gases.</s>
 <s id="10">When our respiratory systems are working correctly, this process happens automatically.</s>
 <s id="11">But the respiratory system can be interrupted by a variety of conditions.</s>
 <s id="12">Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles from contracting.</s>
 <s id="13">Asthma can lead to inflamed airways which obstruct oxygen.</s>
 <s id="14">And pneumonia, often triggered by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves.</s>
 <s id="15">Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup.</s>
 <s id="16">All these situations render the lungs unable to function normally.</s>
 <s id="17">But mechanical ventilators take over the process, getting oxygen into the body when the respiratory system cannot.</s>
 <s id="18">These machines can bypass constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen.</s>
 <s id="19">There are two main ways ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn in through negative pressure ventilation.</s>
 <s id="20">In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates natural breathing and provides an even distribution of air in the lungs.</s>
 <s id="21">To achieve this, doctors created a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in a wooden box or a specially sealed room.</s>
 <s id="22">Air was then pumped out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure, and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily.</s>
 <s id="23">In 1928, doctors developed a portable, metal device with pumps powered by an electric motor.</s>
 <s id="24">This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals through the mid-20th century.</s>
 <s id="25">However, even the most compact negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers.</s>
 <s id="26">This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift towards positive pressure ventilation.</s>
 <s id="27">For milder cases, this can be done non-invasively.</s>
 <s id="28">Often, a facemask is fitted over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air which moves into the patient’s airway.</s>
 <s id="29">But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over the entire breathing process.</s>
 <s id="30">A tube is inserted into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation and exhalation.</s>
 <s id="31">In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s breathing and adjusting the airflow.</s>
 <s id="32">These machines aren’t used as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort.</s>
 <s id="33">Enduring this influx of pressurized air requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation can cause long-term lung damage.</s>
 <s id="34">But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference between life and death.</s>
 <s id="35">And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more essential than we thought.</s>
 <s id="36">Because current models are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate, most hospitals only have a few in supply.</s>
 <s id="37">This may be enough under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, this limited cache is stretched thin.</s>
 <s id="38">The world urgently needs more low-cost and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.</s>
