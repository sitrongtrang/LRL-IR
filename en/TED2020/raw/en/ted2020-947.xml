 <s id="1">Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">For real -- you can take a second.</s>
  <s id="2.2">You've got to feel this to learn it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?</s>
 <s id="4">Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.</s>
 <s id="5">Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.</s>
 <s id="6">Imagine their congratulations, and their high image of you.</s>
 <s id="7">Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?</s>
 <s id="8">Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?</s>
 <s id="9">Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.</s>
 <s id="10">The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.</s>
 <s id="11">Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.</s>
 <s id="12">Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.</s>
 <s id="13">But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."</s>
 <s id="14">The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.</s>
 <s id="15">And then because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.</s>
 <s id="16">(Laughter) So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right?</s>
 <s id="17">So they hold us to it.</s>
 <s id="18">So, let's look at the proof.</s>
 <s id="19">1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this "substitution."</s>
 <s id="20">1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.</s>
 <s id="21">1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this, and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.</s>
 <s id="22">It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests.</s>
 <s id="23">Everyone wrote down their personal goal.</s>
 <s id="24">Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't.</s>
 <s id="25">Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal, but they were told that they could stop at any time.</s>
 <s id="26">Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.</s>
 <s id="27">But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.</s>
 <s id="28">So if this is true, what can we do?</s>
 <s id="29">Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.</s>
 <s id="30">You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings, and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.</s>
 <s id="31">But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction, such as, "I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"</s>
 <s id="32">So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say?</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">(Silence) Exactly!</s>
  <s id="33.2">Well done.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) (Applause)</s>
