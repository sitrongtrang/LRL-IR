 <s id="1">So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.</s>
 <s id="2">But to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is.</s>
 <s id="3">The 404 page is that.</s>
 <s id="4">It's that broken experience on the Web.</s>
 <s id="5">It's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.</s>
 <s id="6">And it serves you the 404 page.</s>
 <s id="7">It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.</s>
 <s id="8">And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself, it's annoying when you hit this thing.</s>
 <s id="9">Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.</s>
 <s id="10">And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about, where does 404 come from?</s>
 <s id="11">It's from a family of errors actually -- a whole set of relationship errors, which, when I started digging into them, it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.</s>
 <s id="12">You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) Yes.</s>
 <s id="14">But these things are everywhere.</s>
 <s id="15">They're on sites big, they're on sites small.</s>
 <s id="16">This is a global experience.</s>
 <s id="17">What a 404 page tells you is that you fell through the cracks.</s>
 <s id="18">And that's not a good experience when you're used to experiences like this.</s>
 <s id="19">You can get on your Kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.</s>
 <s id="20">A 404 page is not what you're looking for.</s>
 <s id="21">You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.</s>
 <s id="22">Trying to think about how a 404 felt, and it would be like if you went to Starbucks and there's the guy behind the counter and you're over there and there's no skim milk.</s>
 <s id="23">And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"</s>
 <s id="24">And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.</s>
 <s id="25">And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."</s>
 <s id="26">That's the 404 feeling.</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) I mean, I've heard about that.</s>
 <s id="28">So where this comes into play and why this is important is I head up a technology incubator, and we had eight startups sitting around there.</s>
 <s id="29">And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not, until one day Athletepath, which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes, found this video.</s>
 <s id="30">(Video) Guy: Joey!</s>
 <s id="31">Crowd: Whoa!</s>
 <s id="32">Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.</s>
 <s id="33">They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.</s>
 <s id="34">Because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) (Applause) So this turned into a contest.</s>
 <s id="36">Dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page.</s>
 <s id="37">Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network, commiserated with your pet.</s>
 <s id="38">Each one of them found this.</s>
 <s id="39">It turned into a 24-hour contest.</s>
 <s id="40">At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.</s>
 <s id="41">And what they learned was that those little things, done right, actually matter, and that well-designed moments can build brands.</s>
 <s id="42">So you take a look out in the real world, and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.</s>
 <s id="43">You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.</s>
 <s id="44">This is one that commiserates with you.</s>
 <s id="45">This is one that blames you.</s>
 <s id="46">This is one that I loved.</s>
 <s id="47">This is an error page, but what if this error page was also an opportunity?</s>
 <s id="48">So it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be.</s>
 <s id="49">Because back to the whole relationship issue, what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not, or it can remind me of why I should love you.</s>
 <s id="50">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="51">(Applause)</s>
