 <s id="1">Before I get to bulk of what I have to say, I feel compelled just to mention a couple of things about myself.</s>
 <s id="2">I am not some mystical, spiritual sort of person.</s>
 <s id="3">I'm a science writer.</s>
 <s id="4">I studied physics in college.</s>
 <s id="5">I used to be a science correspondent for NPR.</s>
 <s id="6">OK, that said: in the course of working on a story for NPR, I got some advice from an astronomer that challenged my outlook, and frankly, changed my life.</s>
 <s id="7">You see, the story was about an eclipse, a partial solar eclipse that was set to cross the country in May of 1994.</s>
 <s id="8">And the astronomer -- I interviewed him, and he explained what was going to happen and how to view it, but he emphasized that, as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is, a much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different.</s>
 <s id="9">In a total eclipse, for all of two or three minutes, the moon completely blocks the face of the sun, creating what he described as the most awe-inspiring spectacle in all of nature.</s>
 <s id="10">And so the advice he gave me was this: "Before you die," he said, "you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse."</s>
 <s id="11">Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable hearing that from someone I didn't know very well; it felt sort of intimate.</s>
 <s id="12">But it got my attention, and so I did some research.</s>
 <s id="13">Now the thing about total eclipses is, if you wait for one to come to you, you're going to be waiting a long time.</s>
 <s id="14">Any given point on earth experiences a total eclipse about once every 400 years.</s>
 <s id="15">But if you're willing to travel, you don't have to wait that long.</s>
 <s id="16">And so I learned that a few years later, in 1998, a total eclipse was going to cross the Caribbean.</s>
 <s id="17">Now, a total eclipse is visible only along a narrow path, about a hundred miles wide, and that's where the moon's shadow falls.</s>
 <s id="18">It's called the "path of totality."</s>
 <s id="19">And in February 1998, the path of totality was going to cross Aruba.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">So I talked to my husband, and we thought: February?</s>
  <s id="20.2">Aruba?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">Sounded like a good idea anyway.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) So we headed south, to enjoy the sun and to see what would happen when the sun briefly went away.</s>
 <s id="23">Well, the day of the eclipse found us and many other people out behind the Hyatt Regency, on the beach, waiting for the show to begin.</s>
 <s id="24">And we wore eclipse glasses with cardboard frames and really dark lenses that enabled us to look at the sun safely.</s>
 <s id="25">A total eclipse begins as a partial eclipse, as the moon very slowly makes its way in front of the sun.</s>
 <s id="26">So first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge, and then that notch grew larger and larger, turning the sun into a crescent.</s>
 <s id="27">And it was all very interesting, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.</s>
 <s id="28">I mean, the day remained bright.</s>
 <s id="29">If I hadn't known what was going on overhead, I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.</s>
 <s id="30">Well, about 10 minutes before the total solar eclipse was set to begin, weird things started to happen.</s>
 <s id="31">A cool wind kicked up.</s>
 <s id="32">Daylight looked odd, and shadows became very strange; they looked bizarrely sharp, as if someone had turned up the contrast knob on the TV.</s>
 <s id="33">Then I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats, so clearly it was getting dark, although I hadn't realized it.</s>
 <s id="34">Well soon, it was obvious it was getting dark.</s>
 <s id="35">It felt like my eyesight was failing.</s>
 <s id="36">And then all of a sudden, the lights went out.</s>
 <s id="37">Well, at that, a cheer erupted from the beach, and I took off my eclipse glasses, because at this point during the total eclipse, it was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye.</s>
 <s id="38">And I glanced upward, and I was just dumbstruck.</s>
 <s id="39">Now, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.</s>
 <s id="40">I had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like.</s>
 <s id="41">I mean -- (Laughter) I'd seen blue skies and grey skies and starry skies and angry skies and pink skies at sunrise.</s>
 <s id="42">But here was a sky I had never seen.</s>
 <s id="43">First, there were the colors.</s>
 <s id="44">Up above, it was a deep purple-grey, like twilight.</s>
 <s id="45">But on the horizon it was orange, like sunset, 360 degrees.</s>
 <s id="46">And up above, in the twilight, bright stars and planets had come out.</s>
 <s id="47">So there was Jupiter and there was Mercury and there was Venus.</s>
 <s id="48">They were all in a line.</s>
 <s id="49">And there, along this line, was this thing, this glorious, bewildering thing.</s>
 <s id="50">It looked like a wreath woven from silvery thread, and it just hung out there in space, shimmering.</s>
 <s id="51">That was the sun's outer atmosphere, the solar corona.</s>
 <s id="52">And pictures just don't do it justice.</s>
 <s id="53">It's not just a ring or halo around the sun; it's finely textured, like it's made out of strands of silk.</s>
 <s id="54">And although it looked nothing like our sun, of course, I knew that's what it was.</s>
 <s id="55">So there was the sun, and there were the planets, and I could see how the planets revolve around the sun.</s>
 <s id="56">It's like I had left our solar system and was standing on some alien world, looking back at creation.</s>
 <s id="57">And for the first time in my life, I just felt viscerally connected to the universe in all of its immensity.</s>
 <s id="58">Time stopped, or it just kind of felt nonexistent, and what I beheld with my eyes -- I didn't just see it, it felt like a vision.</s>
 <s id="59">And I stood there in this nirvana for all of 174 seconds -- less than three minutes -- when all of a sudden, it was over.</s>
 <s id="60">The sun burst out, the blue sky returned, the stars and the planets and the corona were gone.</s>
 <s id="61">The world returned to normal.</s>
 <s id="62">But I had changed.</s>
 <s id="63">And that's how I became an umbraphile -- an eclipse chaser.</s>
 <s id="64">(Laughter) So, this is how I spend my time and hard-earned money.</s>
 <s id="65">Every couple of years, I head off to wherever the moon's shadow will fall to experience another couple minutes of cosmic bliss, and to share the experience with others: with friends in Australia, with an entire city in Germany.</s>
 <s id="66">In 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands who filled the streets and the rooftops and cheered in unison as the solar corona emerged.</s>
 <s id="67">And over time, I've become something else: an eclipse evangelist.</s>
 <s id="68">I see it as my job to pay forward the advice that I received all those years ago.</s>
 <s id="69">And so let me tell you: before you die, you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse.</s>
 <s id="70">It is the ultimate experience of awe.</s>
 <s id="71">Now, that word, "awesome," has grown so overused that it's lost its original meaning.</s>
 <s id="72">True awe, a sense of wonder and insignificance in the face of something enormous and grand, is rare in our lives.</s>
 <s id="73">But when you experience it, it's powerful.</s>
 <s id="74">Awe dissolves the ego.</s>
 <s id="75">It makes us feel connected.</s>
 <s id="76">Indeed, it promotes empathy and generosity.</s>
 <s id="77">Well, there is nothing truly more awesome than a total solar eclipse.</s>
 <s id="78">Unfortunately, few Americans have seen one, because it's been 38 years since one last touched the continental United States and 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation.</s>
 <s id="79">But that is about to change.</s>
 <s id="80">Over the next 35 years, five total solar eclipses will visit the continental United States, and three of them will be especially grand.</s>
 <s id="81">Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 -- (Applause) the moon's shadow will race from Oregon to South Carolina.</s>
 <s id="82">April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow heads north from Texas to Maine.</s>
 <s id="83">In 2045, on August 12, the path cuts from California to Florida.</s>
 <s id="84">I say: What if we made these holidays?</s>
 <s id="85">What if we -- (Laughter) (Applause) What if we all stood together, as many people as possible, in the shadow of the moon?</s>
 <s id="86">Just maybe, this shared experience of awe would help heal our divisions, get us to treat each other just a bit more humanely.</s>
 <s id="87">Now, admittedly, some folks consider my evangelizing a little out there; my obsession, eccentric.</s>
 <s id="88">I mean, why focus so much attention on something so brief?</s>
 <s id="89">Why cross the globe -- or state lines, for that matter -- for something that lasts three minutes?</s>
 <s id="90">As I said: I am not a spiritual person.</s>
 <s id="91">I don't believe in God.</s>
 <s id="92">I wish I did.</s>
 <s id="93">But when I think of my own mortality -- and I do, a lot -- when I think of everyone I have lost, my mother in particular, what soothes me is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.</s>
 <s id="94">I picture myself on that beach, looking at that sky, and I remember how I felt.</s>
 <s id="95">My existence may be temporary, but that's OK because, my gosh, look at what I'm a part of.</s>
 <s id="96">And so this is a lesson I've learned, and it's one that applies to life in general: duration of experience does not equal impact.</s>
 <s id="97">One weekend, one conversation -- hell, one glance -- can change everything.</s>
 <s id="98">Cherish those moments of deep connection with other people, with the natural world, and make them a priority.</s>
 <s id="99">Yes, I chase eclipses.</s>
 <s id="100">You might chase something else.</s>
 <s id="101">But it's not about the 174 seconds.</s>
 <s id="102">It's about how they change the years that come after.</s>
 <s id="103">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="104">(Applause)</s>
