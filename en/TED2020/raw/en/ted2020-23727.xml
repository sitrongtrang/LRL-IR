  <s id="1.1">Which is correct: "A dozen eggs is?"</s>
  <s id="1.2">Or "A dozen eggs are?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">I remember being in elementary school, and my teachers making a big deal about the unit.</s>
 <s id="3">And I never really got that, until one day, I was in the grocery store, and I wanted to buy an apple, but I couldn't buy one apple.</s>
 <s id="4">I had to buy a whole bag of apples.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">So I did.</s>
  <s id="5.2">I bought one bag of apples, I took it home, I took one apple out of the bag, and I cut it up.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">And then I ate one slice.</s>
 <s id="7">One bag, one apple, one slice.</s>
 <s id="8">Which of these is the real "one"?</s>
 <s id="9">Well, they all are of course, and that's what my elementary teachers were trying to tell me.</s>
 <s id="10">Because this is the important idea behind whole number place value, decimal place value and fractions.</s>
 <s id="11">Our whole number system depends on being able to change what we count as "one".</s>
 <s id="12">Our whole number system depends on being able to change units.</s>
 <s id="13">There are two ways to change units.</s>
 <s id="14">We can compose, and we can partition.</s>
 <s id="15">When we compose units, we take a bunch of things, we put them together to make a bigger thing, like a dozen eggs.</s>
 <s id="16">We take 12 eggs, put them together to make a group, and we call that group a dozen.</s>
 <s id="17">A dozen eggs is a composed unit.</s>
 <s id="18">Other examples of composed units include a deck of cards, a pair of shoes, a jazz quartet and of course, Barbie and Ken make a couple.</s>
 <s id="19">But think about a loaf of bread.</s>
 <s id="20">That's not a composed unit, because we don't get a bunch of slices from a bunch of different bakeries and put them together to make a loaf.</s>
 <s id="21">No, we start with a loaf of bread and we cut it into smaller pieces called slices, so each slice of bread is a partitioned unit.</s>
 <s id="22">Other examples of partitioned units include a square of a chocolate bar, a section of an orange and a slice of pizza.</s>
 <s id="23">The important thing about units is that once we've made a new unit, we can treat it just like we did the old unit.</s>
 <s id="24">We can compose composed units, and we can partition partitioned units.</s>
 <s id="25">Think about toaster pastries.</s>
 <s id="26">They come in packs of two, and then those packs get put together in sets of four to make a box.</s>
 <s id="27">So when I buy one box of toaster pastries, am I buying one thing, four things, or eight things?</s>
 <s id="28">It depends on the unit.</s>
 <s id="29">One box, four packs, eight pastries.</s>
 <s id="30">And when I share a slice of pizza with a friend, we have to cut "it" into two smaller pieces.</s>
 <s id="31">So a box of toaster pastries is composed of composed units, and when I split a slice of pizza, I'm partitioning a partitioned unit.</s>
 <s id="32">But what does that have to do with math?</s>
 <s id="33">In math, everything is certain.</s>
 <s id="34">Two plus two equals four, and one is just one.</s>
 <s id="35">But that's not really right.</s>
 <s id="36">One isn't always one.</s>
 <s id="37">Here's why: we start counting at one, and we count up to nine: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then we get to 10, and in order to write 10, we write a one and a zero.</s>
 <s id="38">That one means that we have one group, and the zero helps us remember that it means one group, not one thing.</s>
 <s id="39">But 10, just like one, just like a dozen eggs, just like an egg, 10 is a unit.</s>
 <s id="40">And 10 tens make 100.</s>
 <s id="41">So when I think about 100, it's like the box of toaster pastries.</s>
 <s id="42">Is 100 one thing, 10 things or 100 things?</s>
 <s id="43">And that depends on what "one" is, it depends on what the unit is.</s>
 <s id="44">So think about all the times in math when you write the number one.</s>
 <s id="45">No matter what place that one is in, no matter how many things that one represents, one is.</s>
