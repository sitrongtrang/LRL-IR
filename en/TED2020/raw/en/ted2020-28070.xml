 <s id="1">In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage.</s>
 <s id="2">But what started out as a celebration led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world.</s>
 <s id="3">The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of thousands of people worldwide.</s>
 <s id="4">Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord.</s>
 <s id="5">What makes meningitis so dangerous compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which it invades a person’s body.</s>
 <s id="6">In the worst cases, it causes death within a day.</s>
 <s id="7">Fortunately, that’s rare for patients who receive early medical treatment.</s>
 <s id="8">The disease primarily comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial-- the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on.</s>
 <s id="9">People usually contract bacterial meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and saliva that spray into the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.</s>
 <s id="10">It can also be transmitted through kissing, or sharing cigarettes, toothbrushes or utensils.</s>
 <s id="11">Some people can be infected and carry the disease without showing symptoms or getting sick, which helps the disease spread quickly to others.</s>
 <s id="12">Once the bacteria enter the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding membranes and enter the bloodstream.</s>
 <s id="13">From there, bacteria have rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane called the blood-brain barrier.</s>
 <s id="14">This is made of a tight mesh of cells which separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases.</s>
 <s id="15">But in ways that scientists are still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick the barrier into letting them through.</s>
 <s id="16">Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly infect the meninges.</s>
 <s id="17">This triggers inflammation as the body’s immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever and intense headaches.</s>
 <s id="18">As swelling in the meninges worsens, the neck begins to stiffen.</s>
 <s id="19">Swelling in the brain disrupts its normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss and extreme light sensitivity.</s>
 <s id="20">As pressure increases in the cranium, it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks of the disease.</s>
 <s id="21">A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia, also known as blood poisoning.</s>
 <s id="22">This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots beneath the skin.</s>
 <s id="23">At the same time, these toxins burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to major organs like the lungs and kidneys.</s>
 <s id="24">That increases the chance of organ shut down --and alongside spreading septicemia, threatens death.</s>
 <s id="25">That all sounds scary, but doctors are so good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it.</s>
 <s id="26">The longer it’s left untreated, though, the more likely it will lead to lasting damage.</s>
 <s id="27">If declining oxygen levels cause cell death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs-- the risk of amputation goes up.</s>
 <s id="28">And if bacterial toxins accumulate in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term brain damage and memory loss.</s>
 <s id="29">So fast treatment, or better yet, prevention, is critical.</s>
 <s id="30">That's why most countries have vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms.</s>
 <s id="31">Those are usually given to the people who are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis could potentially happen.</s>
 <s id="32">In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases do happen all over the world.</s>
 <s id="33">If you’re concerned that you or someone you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life.</s>
