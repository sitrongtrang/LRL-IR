 <s id="1">At the temple of the fisherman, Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns.</s>
 <s id="2">It’s a still morning– unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest in a series of troubling signs.</s>
 <s id="3">The year is 1400 BCE.</s>
 <s id="4">Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, treeless desert between the towering Andes and Pacific Ocean.</s>
 <s id="5">The villagers live off the sea, harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, and using them to build fishing boats.</s>
 <s id="6">Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest shellfish and sea urchins.</s>
 <s id="7">In winter, storms bring powerful waves, which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores.</s>
 <s id="8">Most years, Quexo’s village catches more than enough fish.</s>
 <s id="9">But this year, the winds have died and the fish have dwindled.</s>
 <s id="10">Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve mud bricks and wash away settlements.</s>
 <s id="11">He needs to stop the bad weather before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual he’s been planning.</s>
 <s id="12">Quexo spends much less time in the ocean than the other villagers.</s>
 <s id="13">He became a shaman after seeing a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather before him.</s>
 <s id="14">This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain as the sun rises.</s>
 <s id="15">There, he gathers ceremonial cactus and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, along with the mineral hematite.</s>
 <s id="16">Back in the village, everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival at a large temple inland.</s>
 <s id="17">The festival marks the beginning of what is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms, Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory.</s>
 <s id="18">Whole families travel to the festival, where they camp for a few days.</s>
 <s id="19">They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones, gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade in the market around the temple.</s>
 <s id="20">Quexo inspects the goods to make sure everything is of the finest quality.</s>
 <s id="21">He brings the herbs he gathered to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes from the highlands in the Andes.</s>
 <s id="22">He needs cinnabar for his ritual to ward off the storms.</s>
 <s id="23">Around lunchtime, the sprawling temple rises out of the desert ahead.</s>
 <s id="24">People have come from all along the coast and the foothills.</s>
 <s id="25">The women handle trade transactions— they’re looking for cotton and ceramics.</s>
 <s id="26">Men aren’t usually allowed to do the trading, but shamans are an exception.</s>
 <s id="27">Though Quexo is a man, during rituals he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role more flexible outside ceremonies too.</s>
 <s id="28">Quexo can’t find any cinnabar in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza.</s>
 <s id="29">He puts on his ceremonial garb: red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth and vertebrae.</s>
 <s id="30">Inside, the ceremonies are already underway, and the shamans have drunk the sacred cactus drink.</s>
 <s id="31">Many of them are Quexo’s friends from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans who would have cinnabar.</s>
 <s id="32">He begins to panic.</s>
 <s id="33">If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make the long walk into the mountains.</s>
 <s id="34">It’s a dangerous journey that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste.</s>
 <s id="35">But perhaps he has no choice.</s>
 <s id="36">He refuses the sacred cactus and sets off toward the mountains.</s>
 <s id="37">As he leaves the settlement behind, he sees a group approaching.</s>
 <s id="38">He recognizes them as highlanders by their llamas.</s>
 <s id="39">He dashes toward their shaman.</s>
 <s id="40">Barely pausing to say hello, he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime and chew with coca leaves.</s>
 <s id="41">In return, the other shaman gives him the precious cinnabar.</s>
 <s id="42">With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.</s>
