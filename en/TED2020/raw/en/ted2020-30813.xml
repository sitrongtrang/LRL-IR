 <s id="1">As dawn breaks over a moveable city of ten thousand yurts, Queen Boraqchin is in for a rude awakening.</s>
 <s id="2">A rogue sheep has slipped past her servants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed and bleats in her ear.</s>
 <s id="3">Although she’s the formidable khatun of the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on approach to ruling.</s>
 <s id="4">She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson of Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, family and empire at home.</s>
 <s id="5">This makes her the manager – and the mover – of a city of thousands.</s>
 <s id="6">Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city between two seasonal camping grounds.</s>
 <s id="7">This ensures constant water and lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter.</s>
 <s id="8">The whole operation requires weeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her domain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed of dawdling animals.</s>
 <s id="9">Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her ladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer.</s>
 <s id="10">As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running circles around her stewards.</s>
 <s id="11">They’re attempting to stow her possessions securely into wagons.</s>
 <s id="12">Boraqchin orders them to get it under control – but she’s the only one quick enough to catch the stray.</s>
 <s id="13">She next supervises her ladies who are unpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon.</s>
 <s id="14">It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone to steer it but herself.</s>
 <s id="15">Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion meet with the guards.</s>
 <s id="16">She orders them to keep close watch on her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey.</s>
 <s id="17">They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the route, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check.</s>
 <s id="18">But when the sheep finally breaks free and makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds packing up their yurts.</s>
 <s id="19">Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down to the pastures herself.</s>
 <s id="20">When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep wriggling into the middle of a flock.</s>
 <s id="21">When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother.</s>
 <s id="22">She’s pregnant, and seems to be in pain.</s>
 <s id="23">With a start, Boraqchin realizes that this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in the flurry of moving day.</s>
 <s id="24">There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, greases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new additions to the empire.</s>
 <s id="25">Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp.</s>
 <s id="26">Here the final touches have been put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up.</s>
 <s id="27">This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons filled with her treasures.</s>
 <s id="28">Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp.</s>
 <s id="29">After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives.</s>
 <s id="30">Boraqchin has been checking in with them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue.</s>
 <s id="31">But they only make up the royal portion of the line – behind them winds the entire civilian city, which includes holy men with portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds.</s>
 <s id="32">Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon.</s>
 <s id="33">It’ll take weeks to reach their destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children and attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep at the back of line.</s>
