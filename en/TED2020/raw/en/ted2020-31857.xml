 <s id="1">The greatest challenge a vampire hunter can take on is to bring sunlight into a vampire's lair.</s>
 <s id="2">You’ve stealthily descended into the darkness of a vampire cave, setting a sequence of mirrors as you go.</s>
 <s id="3">When the sun reaches the right angle in the sky, a focused beam of light will ricochet along the mirrors, strike your diffuser, and illuminate the great chamber where the vampires sleep.</s>
 <s id="4">You set the final mirror and sneak through an opening in the corner of the great chamber.</s>
 <s id="5">The diffuser must be wall-mounted, but the walls are crowded with coffins, which you don’t dare disturb.</s>
 <s id="6">The only open spots are in the other three corners of the room.</s>
 <s id="7">The light will enter through the southwest corner at a 45 degree angle and bounce off the perfectly smooth metallic walls until it hits one of the other three corners.</s>
 <s id="8">But which corner will it hit?</s>
 <s id="9">You know the room is a rectangle 49 meters wide and 78 meters long.</s>
 <s id="10">You could probably find the answer by drawing a scale model of the room and tracing the path of the light, but the sun will be in its place in just minutes, and you’ve got no time to spare.</s>
 <s id="11">Fortunately, there’s a different way to solve this puzzle that’s both simple and elegant.</s>
 <s id="12">So in which corner should you place the diffuser to flood the vampire lair with sunlight?</s>
 <s id="13">Pause the video if you want to figure it out for yourself.</s>
 <s id="14">Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could tackle this problem by examining smaller rooms, and you’d find a lot of interesting patterns.</s>
 <s id="15">But there’s one insight that can unravel this riddle in almost no time at all.</s>
 <s id="16">Let’s draw the chamber on a coordinate grid, with the Southwest corner at the point (0,0).</s>
 <s id="17">The light passes through grid points with coordinates that are either both even or both odd.</s>
 <s id="18">This is true even after it bounces off one or more walls.</s>
 <s id="19">Another way of thinking about it is this: since the light travels at a 45 degree angle, it always crosses the diagonal of a unit square.</s>
 <s id="20">Traveling 1 meter horizontally changes the x coordinate from even to odd or vice versa.</s>
 <s id="21">Traveling 1 meter vertically changes the y coordinate from even to odd or vice versa.</s>
 <s id="22">Traveling diagonally – as the light does here – does both at once, so the x and y coordinates of any points the light passes through must be both even, or both odd.</s>
 <s id="23">This observation is more powerful than it seems.</s>
 <s id="24">In particular, it means that we have a way to identify the kinds of points the light won’t ever go through If one of the coordinates is even and the other is odd, the light will miss them.</s>
 <s id="25">That means it’ll miss the top two corners of the room, since those points have one even and one odd coordinate.</s>
 <s id="26">The Southeast corner is the only option for the diffuser.</s>
 <s id="27">And indeed, when that precious beam of sunlight enters the hall, it bounces between the walls and strikes the Southeast corner, spot on.</s>
 <s id="28">The vampires, sensing the intrusion, burst from their coffins and turn to dust in the light.</s>
 <s id="29">It was a “high stakes” test, and you passed with flying colors.</s>
