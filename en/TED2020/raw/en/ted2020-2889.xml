 <s id="1">What are you doing on this stage in front of all these people?</s>
 <s id="2">(Laughter) Run!</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) Run now.</s>
 <s id="4">That's the voice of my anxiety talking.</s>
 <s id="5">Even when there's absolutely nothing wrong, I sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom, like danger is lurking just around the corner.</s>
 <s id="6">You see, a few years ago, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression -- two conditions that often go hand in hand.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, there was a time I wouldn't have told anybody, especially not in front of a big audience.</s>
 <s id="8">As a black woman, I've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed.</s>
 <s id="9">And like most people in my community, I had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness, a character flaw.</s>
 <s id="10">But I wasn't weak; I was a high achiever.</s>
 <s id="11">I'd earned a Master's degree in Media Studies and had a string of high-profile jobs in the film and television industries.</s>
 <s id="12">I'd even won two Emmy Awards for my hard work.</s>
 <s id="13">Sure, I was totally spent, I lacked interest in things I used to enjoy, barely ate, struggled with insomnia and felt isolated and depleted.</s>
 <s id="14">But depressed?</s>
 <s id="15">No, not me.</s>
 <s id="16">It took weeks before I could admit it, but the doctor was right: I was depressed.</s>
 <s id="17">Still, I didn't tell anybody about my diagnosis.</s>
 <s id="18">I was too ashamed.</s>
 <s id="19">I didn't think I had the right to be depressed.</s>
 <s id="20">I had a privileged life with a loving family and a successful career.</s>
 <s id="21">And when I thought about the unspeakable horrors that my ancestors had been through in this country so that I could have it better, my shame grew even deeper.</s>
 <s id="22">I was standing on their shoulders.</s>
 <s id="23">How could I let them down?</s>
 <s id="24">I would hold my head up, put a smile on my face and never tell a soul.</s>
 <s id="25">On July 4, 2013, my world came crashing in on me.</s>
 <s id="26">That was the day I got a phone call from my mom telling me that my 22-year-old nephew, Paul, had ended his life, after years of battling depression and anxiety.</s>
 <s id="27">There are no words that can describe the devastation I felt.</s>
 <s id="28">Paul and I were very close, but I had no idea he was in so much pain.</s>
 <s id="29">Neither one of us had ever talked to the other about our struggles.</s>
 <s id="30">The shame and stigma kept us both silent.</s>
 <s id="31">Now, my way of dealing with adversity is to face it head on, so I spent the next two years researching depression and anxiety, and what I found was mind-blowing.</s>
 <s id="32">The World Health Organization reports that depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability in the world.</s>
 <s id="33">While the exact cause of depression isn't clear, research suggests that most mental disorders develop, at least in part, because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, and/or an underlying genetic predisposition.</s>
 <s id="34">So you can't just shake it off.</s>
 <s id="35">For black Americans, stressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities put them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder, yet they seek mental health services at about half the rate of white Americans.</s>
 <s id="36">One reason is the stigma, with 63 percent of black Americans mistaking depression for a weakness.</s>
 <s id="37">Sadly, the suicide rate among black children has doubled in the past 20 years.</s>
 <s id="38">Now, here's the good news: seventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve with therapy, treatment and medication.</s>
 <s id="39">Armed with this information, I made a decision: I wasn't going to be silent anymore.</s>
 <s id="40">With my family's blessing, I would share our story in hopes of sparking a national conversation.</s>
 <s id="41">A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said, "Being strong is killing us."</s>
 <s id="42">She's right.</s>
 <s id="43">We have got to retire those tired, old narratives of the strong black woman and the super-masculine black man, who, no matter how many times they get knocked down, just shake it off and soldier on.</s>
 <s id="44">Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.</s>
 <s id="45">Feelings mean we're human.</s>
 <s id="46">And when we deny our humanity, it leaves us feeling empty inside, searching for ways to self-medicate in order to fill the void.</s>
 <s id="47">My drug was high achievement.</s>
 <s id="48">These days, I share my story openly, and I ask others to share theirs, too.</s>
 <s id="49">I believe that's what it takes to help people who may be suffering in silence to know that they are not alone and to know that with help, they can heal.</s>
 <s id="50">Now, I still have my struggles, particularly with the anxiety, but I'm able to manage it through daily mediation, yoga and a relatively healthy diet.</s>
 <s id="51">(Laughter) If I feel like things are starting to spiral, I make an appointment to see my therapist, a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, who has a great sense of humor and a familiarity that I find comforting.</s>
 <s id="52">I will always regret that I couldn't be there for my nephew.</s>
 <s id="53">But my sincerest hope is that I can inspire others with the lesson that I've learned.</s>
 <s id="54">Life is beautiful.</s>
 <s id="55">Sometimes it's messy, and it's always unpredictable.</s>
 <s id="56">But it will all be OK when you have your support system to help you through it.</s>
 <s id="57">I hope that if your burden gets too heavy, you'll ask for a hand, too.</s>
 <s id="58">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="59">(Applause)</s>
