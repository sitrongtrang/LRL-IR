 <s id="1">What is at the center of the universe?</s>
 <s id="2">It's an essential question that humans have been wondering about for centuries.</s>
 <s id="3">But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one.</s>
 <s id="4">If you wanted to know the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might look up at the night sky and trust what you see.</s>
 <s id="5">That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask back then, did.</s>
 <s id="6">He thought that since we're on Earth, looking up, it must be the center, right?</s>
 <s id="7">For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air, and fire.</s>
 <s id="8">These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres.</s>
 <s id="9">Each of the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere.</s>
 <s id="10">The rest of the universe and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere.</s>
 <s id="11">If you watch the sky change over time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw.</s>
 <s id="12">For centuries, this was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the universe.</s>
 <s id="13">But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model.</s>
 <s id="14">He believed that the sun was at the center of the universe.</s>
 <s id="15">This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to accept.</s>
 <s id="16">After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were pretty flattering to humans.</s>
 <s id="17">But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric model hard to ignore.</s>
 <s id="18">First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect circles or spheres.</s>
 <s id="19">Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth.</s>
 <s id="20">And then, Newton proposed the theory of universal gravitation, demonstrating that all objects are pulling on each other.</s>
 <s id="21">Eventually, we had to let go of the idea that we were at the center of the universe.</s>
 <s id="22">Shortly after Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite.</s>
 <s id="23">This idea didn't go over well.</s>
 <s id="24">Bruno was burned at the stake for his radical suggestion.</s>
 <s id="25">Centuries later, the philosopher Rene Descartes proposed that the universe was a series of whirlpools, which he called vortices, and that each star was at the center of a whirlpool.</s>
 <s id="26">In time, we realized there were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed.</s>
 <s id="27">As astronomers like William Herschel got more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many stars inside the Milky Way.</s>
 <s id="28">And those smudges we see in the night sky?</s>
 <s id="29">They're other galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home.</s>
 <s id="30">Maybe we're farther from the center than we ever realized.</s>
 <s id="31">In the 1920s, astronomers studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they were moving.</s>
 <s id="32">Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away.</s>
 <s id="33">But all they saw was a red shift.</s>
 <s id="34">Everything was moving away from us, fast.</s>
 <s id="35">This observation is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang Theory.</s>
 <s id="36">According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular, infinitely dense particle.</s>
 <s id="37">In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center.</s>
 <s id="38">But this theory eliminates the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center to an infinite universe.</s>
 <s id="39">The Big Bang wasn't just an explosion in space; it was an explosion of space.</s>
 <s id="40">What each new discovery proves is that while our observations are limited, our ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't.</s>
 <s id="41">What we think we know today can change tomorrow.</s>
 <s id="42">As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more perplexing questions.</s>
