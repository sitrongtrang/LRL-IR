 <s id="1">Ethanol: this molecule, made of little more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness.</s>
 <s id="2">Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages.</s>
 <s id="3">Its simplicity helps it sneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects compared to other, clunkier molecules.</s>
 <s id="4">So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically different effects on different people?</s>
 <s id="5">To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol on its journey through the body.</s>
 <s id="6">Alcohol lands in the stomach and is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract, especially the small intestine.</s>
 <s id="7">The contents of the stomach impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because after eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach from the small intestine, closes.</s>
 <s id="8">So the level of alcohol that reaches the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that from the same drink on an empty stomach.</s>
 <s id="9">From the blood, alcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get the most blood flow: the liver and the brain.</s>
 <s id="10">It hits the liver first, and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule in two steps.</s>
 <s id="11">First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is toxic.</s>
 <s id="12">Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate.</s>
 <s id="13">As the blood circulates, the liver eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs.</s>
 <s id="14">Brain sensitivity is responsible for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— otherwise known as drunkenness.</s>
 <s id="15">Alcohol turns up the brain’s primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, the neurotransmitter glutamate.</s>
 <s id="16">This makes neurons much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, fall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity necessary for survival at toxic doses.</s>
 <s id="17">Alcohol also stimulates a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation.</s>
 <s id="18">Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure.</s>
 <s id="19">Alcohol also causes some neurons to synthesize and release endorphins.</s>
 <s id="20">Endorphins help us to calm down in response to stress or danger.</s>
 <s id="21">Elevated levels of endorphins contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated with alcohol consumption.</s>
 <s id="22">Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol outpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away.</s>
 <s id="23">Individual differences at any point in this journey can cause people to act more or less drunk.</s>
 <s id="24">For example, a man and a woman who weigh the same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have different blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs.</s>
 <s id="25">This is because women tend to have less blood— women generally have a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle.</s>
 <s id="26">A smaller blood volume, carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration will be higher for women.</s>
 <s id="27">Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol processing enzymes also influence BAC.</s>
 <s id="28">And regular drinking can increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance.</s>
 <s id="29">On the other hand, those who drink excessively for a long time may develop liver damage, which has the opposite effect.</s>
 <s id="30">Meanwhile, genetic differences in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder.</s>
 <s id="31">Those with naturally low endorphin or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking.</s>
 <s id="32">Some people have a higher risk for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol.</s>
 <s id="33">Others have a variation in GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive to the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing disordered drinking.</s>
 <s id="34">Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, and enhancing glutamate activity.</s>
 <s id="35">This means regular drinkers tend to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure.</s>
 <s id="36">These structural and functional changes can lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle.</s>
 <s id="37">So both genetics and previous experience impact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people are more prone to certain patterns of drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads to neural and behavioral changes.</s>
