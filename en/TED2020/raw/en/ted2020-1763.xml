 <s id="1">Everything is interconnected.</s>
 <s id="2">As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.</s>
 <s id="3">We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.</s>
 <s id="4">When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.</s>
 <s id="5">There were no clouds in the sky.</s>
 <s id="6">And after a while I began to perspire.</s>
 <s id="7">And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that?</s>
 <s id="8">That's part of you up there.</s>
 <s id="9">That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals."</s>
 <s id="10">In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."</s>
 <s id="11">And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do.</s>
 <s id="12">These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.</s>
 <s id="13">They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them.</s>
 <s id="14">Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.</s>
 <s id="15">There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.</s>
 <s id="16">And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.</s>
 <s id="17">I've learned to respect the lightning.</s>
 <s id="18">My hair used to be straight.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) I'm just kidding.</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.</s>
 <s id="21">They become lovely monsters.</s>
 <s id="22">When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.</s>
 <s id="23">As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">All my relations.</s>
  <s id="24.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">(Applause)</s>
