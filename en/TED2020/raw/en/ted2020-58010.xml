 <s id="1">You're probably familiar with FOMO.</s>
 <s id="2">[This guy invented the term] That's short for "Fear Of Missing Out."</s>
 <s id="3">It's that feeling you get when it seems everyone else is doing something better than what you're doing now.</s>
 <s id="4">But there's another FO you need to know about, and it's far more dangerous.</s>
 <s id="5">It's called FOBO, and it's short for "Fear Of a Better Option."</s>
 <s id="6">[The Way We Work] We live in a world of overwhelming choice.</s>
 <s id="7">Even decisions that used to be simple, like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases, are now fraught with overanalysis.</s>
 <s id="8">Technology has only made the issue more pronounced.</s>
 <s id="9">If you want to buy a pair of white shoelaces online, you have to sort through thousands of items and read through hundreds of reviews.</s>
 <s id="10">That's an astounding amount of information to process to just buy two pieces of string that cost less than your morning latte.</s>
 <s id="11">Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you've struggled to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes.</s>
 <s id="12">It's a symptom of a culture which sees value in collecting and preserving as many options as possible.</s>
 <s id="13">You might wonder why all of this is so bad.</s>
 <s id="14">It seems counterintuitive.</s>
 <s id="15">Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options to choose from?</s>
 <s id="16">The problem is, FOBO induces such severe analysis paralysis that it can negatively impact both your personal and professional life.</s>
 <s id="17">When you can't make decisions with conviction, you waste precious time and energy.</s>
 <s id="18">Luckily, there is a way to overcome FOBO.</s>
 <s id="19">Here's a secret.</s>
 <s id="20">With any decision you make, you first have to determine the stakes, as this will inform your decision-making strategy.</s>
 <s id="21">When it comes down to it, you only really face three types of decisions in life: high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.</s>
 <s id="22">Let's start with no-stakes decisions.</s>
 <s id="23">These are the minor details of life, where there is almost never an incorrect answer, and in a few hours, you won't even remember making the decision.</s>
 <s id="24">A good example of this is choosing what to watch on TV.</s>
 <s id="25">With thousands of shows, it's easy to get overwhelmed, yet no matter what you pick, the consequences are basically nonexistent.</s>
 <s id="26">So spending more than a few moments on FOBO is a massive waste of energy.</s>
 <s id="27">You just need to move on.</s>
 <s id="28">When it comes to no-stakes decisions, the key is to outsource them to the universe.</s>
 <s id="29">For example, you can whittle down your choices to just two and then flip a coin.</s>
 <s id="30">Or try my personal favorite -- ask the watch.</s>
 <s id="31">Assign each one of your choices to one half of your watch, then let the second hand tell you what you're going to do.</s>
 <s id="32">Looks like I'll be having the fish.</s>
 <s id="33">That brings us to low-stakes decisions.</s>
 <s id="34">These have consequences, but none are earth-shattering, and there are plenty of acceptable outcomes.</s>
 <s id="35">Many routine things at work, like purchasing a printer, booking a hotel or choosing between possible venues for an off-site are classically low-stakes in nature.</s>
 <s id="36">Some thinking is required, but these aren't make-or-break deliberations, and you'll probably forget about them in a few weeks.</s>
 <s id="37">Here, you can also outsource decision-making, but you want some critical thinking involved, as there are some stakes.</s>
 <s id="38">This time, you'll outsource to a person.</s>
 <s id="39">Set some basic criteria, select someone to present a recommendation, and then take their advice.</s>
 <s id="40">Make sure to avoid the temptation to canvass.</s>
 <s id="41">Your goal is to clear your plate, not to kick the can down the road.</s>
 <s id="42">Now that you tackled low-stakes and no-stakes decisions, you've created the space and time you'll need to handle high-stakes decisions.</s>
 <s id="43">These are things like "which house should I buy" or "which job should I accept."</s>
 <s id="44">Since the stakes are high and there are long-term implications, you absolutely want to get it right.</s>
 <s id="45">Before we get to work, let's establish a few basic principles to guide you through the process.</s>
 <s id="46">First, think about what really matters to you, and set your criteria accordingly.</s>
 <s id="47">Second, gather the relevant facts.</s>
 <s id="48">Make sure you collect data about all of the options, so you can be confident that you're truly making an informed decision.</s>
 <s id="49">And third, remember that FOBO, by nature, comes when you struggle to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable options.</s>
 <s id="50">So no matter what you choose, you can rest assured that the downside is limited.</s>
 <s id="51">Now that you've established some ground rules, the process can begin.</s>
 <s id="52">Start by identifying a front-runner based on your intuition, then compare each of your options head-to-head with the front-runner, one-by-one.</s>
 <s id="53">Each time, choose the better of the two based on the criteria, and discard the other one.</s>
 <s id="54">Here's the trick to avoiding FOBO.</s>
 <s id="55">When you eliminate an option, it's gone forever.</s>
 <s id="56">If you keep returning to discarded options, you risk getting stuck.</s>
 <s id="57">Now repeat this process until you get down to one final choice.</s>
 <s id="58">If you follow this system, you will usually end up with a decision on your own.</s>
 <s id="59">On the rare occasion that you get stuck, you will outsource the final decision to a small group of qualified people who you trust and who are equipped to provide you with guidance on this particular topic.</s>
 <s id="60">Engage a group of five or less, ideally an odd number of people so that you have a built-in tiebreaker if you need it.</s>
 <s id="61">Now that you've made your choice, one last challenge remains.</s>
 <s id="62">You have to commit.</s>
 <s id="63">I can't promise you that you'll ever truly know if you've made the perfect decision, but I can tell you this: a significant percentage of people in the world will never have to worry about FOBO.</s>
 <s id="64">Unlike the billions of people who have few options, if any, due to war, poverty or illness, you have plentiful opportunities to live decisively.</s>
 <s id="65">You may not get everything you want, but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful.</s>
 <s id="66">In fact, it's a gift.</s>
 <s id="67">Make the most of it.</s>
