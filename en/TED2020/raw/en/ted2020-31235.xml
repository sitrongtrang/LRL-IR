 <s id="1">We survey CEOs, police officers, truck drivers, cooks, engineers.</s>
 <s id="2">If people are working, we've surveyed them.</s>
 <s id="3">And what we know, in terms of their happiness: workers all want the same things.</s>
 <s id="4">[The Way We Work] There's three billion working people in the world.</s>
 <s id="5">And about 40 percent of them would say they're happy at work.</s>
 <s id="6">That means about 1.8 billion, or almost two billion people, are not happy at work.</s>
 <s id="7">What does that do, both to those people and the organizations that they work in?</s>
 <s id="8">Well, let's talk about money.</s>
 <s id="9">Organizations that have a lot of happy employees have three times the revenue growth, compared to organizations where that's not true.</s>
 <s id="10">They outperform the stock market by a factor of three.</s>
 <s id="11">And if you look at employee turnover, it's half that of organizations that have a lot of unhappy employees.</s>
 <s id="12">The miracle thing is, you don't have to spend more money to make this happen.</s>
 <s id="13">It's not about ping-pong tables and massages and pet walking.</s>
 <s id="14">It's not about the perks.</s>
 <s id="15">It's all about how they're treated by their leaders and by the people that they work with.</s>
 <s id="16">So I'd like to share a few ideas that create happy employees.</s>
 <s id="17">Idea number one: in organizations where employees are happy, what you find is two things are present: trust and respect.</s>
 <s id="18">Leaders often say, "We trust our employees.</s>
 <s id="19">We empower our employees."</s>
 <s id="20">And then when an employee needs a laptop -- and this is a true example -- 15 people have to approve that laptop.</s>
 <s id="21">So for the employee, all the words are right, but 15 levels of approval for a $1,500 laptop?</s>
 <s id="22">You've actually spent more money than the laptop, on the approval.</s>
 <s id="23">And the employee feels maybe they're really not trusted.</s>
 <s id="24">So what can an organization do to have a high level of trust?</s>
 <s id="25">The first organization that comes to mind is Four Seasons.</s>
 <s id="26">They have magnificent properties all around the world.</s>
 <s id="27">And their employees are told, "Do whatever you think is right when servicing the customer."</s>
 <s id="28">To hand that trust to your employees to do whatever they think is right makes the employees feel great.</s>
 <s id="29">And this is why they're known for delivering some of the best service in the world.</s>
 <s id="30">Idea number two: fairness.</s>
 <s id="31">The thing that erodes trust in an organization faster than anything else is when employees feel that they're being treated unfairly.</s>
 <s id="32">Employees want to be treated the same, regardless of their rank or their tenure or their age or their experience or their job category, compared to anyone else.</s>
 <s id="33">When I think about great organizations who get fairness right, the first organization that comes to mind is Salesforce.</s>
 <s id="34">They found that men and women working in the same job with the same level of proficiency were making different amounts of money.</s>
 <s id="35">So immediately, they calculated the difference, and they invested three million dollars to try and balance things out.</s>
 <s id="36">Idea number three is listening.</s>
 <s id="37">So, to be a listener who connects with all types of people, we have to unlearn a few things.</s>
 <s id="38">We've all been taught about active listening and eye contact -- an intense stare and a compassionate look.</s>
 <s id="39">That's not listening.</s>
 <s id="40">Repeating what the person says -- that's not listening.</s>
 <s id="41">Being humble and always hunting and searching for the best idea possible -- that's what listening is.</s>
 <s id="42">And employees can feel whether you're doing that or not.</s>
 <s id="43">They want to know, when they talk to you and share an idea, did you consider it when you made a decision?</s>
 <s id="44">The one thing that everybody appreciates and wants when they're speaking is to know that what they say matters so much you might actually change your mind.</s>
 <s id="45">Otherwise, what's the point of the conversation?</s>
 <s id="46">We all know the things we need to change, the things that we need to do differently.</s>
 <s id="47">The way you behave, the way you treat others, the way you respond, the way you support, defines the work experience for everyone around you.</s>
 <s id="48">Changing to be a better person -- the world is littered with those failures.</s>
 <s id="49">But changing because there's something you believe in, some purpose that you have, where you're willing to risk almost everything because it's so important to you -- that's the reason to change.</s>
 <s id="50">If it's not, you should probably find a different place to work.</s>
