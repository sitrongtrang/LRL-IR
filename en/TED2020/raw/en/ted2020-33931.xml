 <s id="1">We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all matter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact state about 14 billion years ago.</s>
 <s id="2">And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate.</s>
 <s id="3">But what about the future?</s>
 <s id="4">Do we know how our universe is going to end?</s>
 <s id="5">Cosmologists have three possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch.</s>
 <s id="6">To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies.</s>
 <s id="7">A short, tight rubber band is holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity.</s>
 <s id="8">Meanwhile, two hooks are pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force expanding the universe.</s>
 <s id="9">Copy this system over and over again, and you have something approximating the real universe.</s>
 <s id="10">The outcome of the battle between these two opposing forces determines how the end of the universe will play out.</s>
 <s id="11">The Big Freeze scenario is what happens if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the rubber band until it loses its elasticity.</s>
 <s id="12">The expansion wouldn’t be able to accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep getting bigger.</s>
 <s id="13">Clusters of galaxies would separate.</s>
 <s id="14">The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into lonely objects floating separately in the vast space.</s>
 <s id="15">The light they emit would be redshifted to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them would be too thin to create new stars.</s>
 <s id="16">The universe would become darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe.</s>
 <s id="17">But what if the repulsive force is so strong that it stretches the rubber band past its elastic limit, and actually tears it?</s>
 <s id="18">If the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together.</s>
 <s id="19">As a result, the matter that makes up stars breaks into tiny pieces.</s>
 <s id="20">Even atoms and subatomic particles will be destroyed.</s>
 <s id="21">That’s the Big Rip.</s>
 <s id="22">What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out?</s>
 <s id="23">That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it.</s>
 <s id="24">Galaxies would start rushing towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would get even stronger.</s>
 <s id="25">Stars too would hurtle together and collide.</s>
 <s id="26">Temperatures would rise as space would get tighter and tighter.</s>
 <s id="27">The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles would have to crunch together.</s>
 <s id="28">The result would be an incredibly dense, hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that preceded the Big Bang.</s>
 <s id="29">This is the Big Crunch.</s>
 <s id="30">Could this tiny point of matter explode in another Big Bang?</s>
 <s id="31">Could the universe expand and contract over and over again, repeating its entire history?</s>
 <s id="32">The theory describing such a universe is known as the Big Bounce.</s>
 <s id="33">In fact, there’s no way to tell how many bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future.</s>
 <s id="34">Each bounce would wipe away any record of the universe’s previous history.</s>
 <s id="35">Which one of those scenarios will be the real one?</s>
 <s id="36">The answer depends on the exact shape of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate.</s>
 <s id="37">As of now, our observations suggest that we’re heading for a Big Freeze.</s>
 <s id="38">But the good news is that we’ve probably got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up on mittens just yet.</s>
