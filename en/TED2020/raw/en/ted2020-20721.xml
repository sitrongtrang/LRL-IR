 <s id="1">It’s another sweltering morning in Memphis, Egypt.</s>
 <s id="2">As the sunlight brightens the Nile, Peseshet checks her supplies.</s>
 <s id="3">Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil.</s>
 <s id="4">She’s well stocked with the essentials she needs to treat her patients.</s>
 <s id="5">Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor.</s>
 <s id="6">In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored at the Per Ankh, the House of Life.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, she teaches her own students there.</s>
 <s id="8">Before teaching, Peseshet has a patient to see.</s>
 <s id="9">One of the workers at the temple construction site has injured his arm.</s>
 <s id="10">When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, with multiple bone fragments.</s>
 <s id="11">Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury.</s>
 <s id="12">Her next stop is the House of Life.</s>
 <s id="13">On her way, a woman intercepts Peseshet in the street.</s>
 <s id="14">The woman’s son has been stung by a scorpion.</s>
 <s id="15">Peseshet has seen many similar stings and knows exactly what to do.</s>
 <s id="16">She must say an incantation to cast the poison out.</s>
 <s id="17">She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians and goddess of venomous creatures.</s>
 <s id="18">Peseshet recites the spell as if she is Serqet.</s>
 <s id="19">This commanding approach has the greatest chance at success.</s>
 <s id="20">After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out with a knife for good measure.</s>
 <s id="21">Peseshet packs up to leave, but the woman has another question.</s>
 <s id="22">She wants to find out if she is pregnant.</s>
 <s id="23">Peseshet explains her fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer.</s>
 <s id="24">Then, urinate on the seeds every day.</s>
 <s id="25">If the plants grow, she’s pregnant.</s>
 <s id="26">A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl.</s>
 <s id="27">Peseshet also recommends a prayer to Hathor, goddess of fertility.</s>
 <s id="28">When Peseshet finally arrives at the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi.</s>
 <s id="29">She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks priests are very full of themselves.</s>
 <s id="30">She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role as neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman of the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus.</s>
 <s id="31">Inside, the House of Life is bustling as usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students.</s>
 <s id="32">Papyri containing all kinds of records, not just medical information, are stored here.</s>
 <s id="33">Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard at work copying documents as part of his training to become a scribe.</s>
 <s id="34">He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her.</s>
 <s id="35">Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, and impossible for girls, to pursue this education.</s>
 <s id="36">Peseshet oversees all the female swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis.</s>
 <s id="37">The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors won’t answer to a woman.</s>
 <s id="38">Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy.</s>
 <s id="39">She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits.</s>
 <s id="40">Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her at the door and begs to be examined.</s>
 <s id="41">The woman has a huge, sore lump under her arm.</s>
 <s id="42">Peseshet probes the growth and finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit.</s>
 <s id="43">She has read about ailments like this, but never seen one.</s>
 <s id="44">For this tumor there is no treatment, medicine or spell.</s>
 <s id="45">All the texts give the same advice: do nothing.</s>
 <s id="46">After delivering the bad news, Peseshet goes outside.</s>
 <s id="47">She lingers on the steps of the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk.</s>
 <s id="48">In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients she can’t help, like the woman with the tumor.</s>
 <s id="49">They linger with her, but Peseshet has no time to dwell.</s>
 <s id="50">In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for the next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients.</s>
