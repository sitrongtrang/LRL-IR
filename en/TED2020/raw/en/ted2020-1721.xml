  <s id="7.1">When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy, as he did.</s>
  <s id="7.2">(Laughter) After finishing this series of protests, I started questioning why my fate was like this, and I realized that it's not just me -- all Chinese are as confused as I am.</s>

 <s id="8">As you can see, these works are about family planning, election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.</s>
 <s id="9">This work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").</s>
 <s id="10">"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".</s>

 <s id="22">This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.</s>
 <s id="23">Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.</s>
 <s id="24">(Applause) LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye, but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.</s>

 <s id="26">But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.</s>
 <s id="27">Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye, but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.</s>

 <s id="37">LB: This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome.</s>
 <s id="38">When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.</s>

 <s id="43">These phosphors can even cause cancer.</s>
 <s id="44">To create this artwork, I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">And my task is to stand there, trying to be still, setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body on the front of my body.</s>
  <s id="45.2">If the background is simple, I usually have to stand for three to four hours.</s>

 </p>
 <s id="53">I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.</s>
 <s id="54">If an artwork is to touch someone, it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.</s>
 <s id="55">And the repeated struggles in life create artwork, no matter in what form.</s>
