 <s id="1">My name is Glenn, I'm 25, and I don't know my real last name.</s>
 <s id="2">It's not uncommon in America.</s>
 <s id="3">Most black people in this country are walking around with a slave owner's last name.</s>
 <s id="4">Black history has been systemically erased and altered for centuries.</s>
 <s id="5">As I give this talk, there are more than 700 Confederate monuments standing nationwide.</s>
 <s id="6">These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers who fought to maintain slavery -- mostly in the South -- from the 1890s to the 1950s, when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect.</s>
 <s id="7">To this day, black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders in our public spaces.</s>
 <s id="8">These memorials are a physical representation of a system that is actively working to define whose lives matter and whose lives do not.</s>
 <s id="9">If we are going to disrupt the narrative, we have to start at the origin.</s>
 <s id="10">Genocide, slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas with Christopher Columbus.</s>
 <s id="11">Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 1492.</s>
 <s id="12">Fewer people know that an estimated 250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out within two years of his arrival.</s>
 <s id="13">Even fewer people know that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doña Juana de la Torre that "nine and 10-year-old girls were in high demand, and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid."</s>
 <s id="14">Yet New York City's Columbus Circle has had him perched 76 feet high next to Central Park since 1892.</s>
 <s id="15">I started Movers and Shakers, a nonprofit, to get the statue removed.</s>
 <s id="16">Movers and Shakers is a group of activists, artists, educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology to highlight the narratives of the oppressed.</s>
 <s id="17">In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal, we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism.</s>
 <s id="18">We created an augmented reality installation on the true story of Christopher Columbus and used it to host teach-ins in Columbus Circle and Times Square.</s>
 <s id="19">Many see the controversy around the statue as tension between the Italian-American community and the indigenous community.</s>
 <s id="20">The reality is that most black people are here in this country as a result of the atrocities that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus.</s>
 <s id="21">So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade.</s>
 <s id="22">I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue.</s>
 <s id="23">I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment at their football team's home opener.</s>
 <s id="24">We gave it everything that we had, but in the end, New York City decided to keep the statue, and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark.</s>
 <s id="25">The news was devastating, but it opened up another door.</s>
 <s id="26">We realized that with augmented reality you don't need permission from the government to put up a monument or to make a statement.</s>
 <s id="27">You can just do it.</s>
 <s id="28">So New York City right now currently has more than 150 statues of men and six of women and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well.</s>
 <s id="29">So we decided, why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments of women and people of color throughout the city?</s>
 <s id="30">Typically, monuments are created to commemorate the achievements of the deceased, but with augmented reality, we can reroute the rules.</s>
 <s id="31">We started with sports.</s>
 <s id="32">Colin Kaepernick.</s>
 <s id="33">He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, and he wanted to use his platform to highlight the injustice of systemic racism.</s>
 <s id="34">So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this, and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem.</s>
 <s id="35">He lost his contract with the 49ers, he was blackballed by every NFL owner, he was criticized by millions and even the president of the United States decided to insult him.</s>
 <s id="36">It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage, so our team decided to do this.</s>
 <s id="37">Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee in augmented reality, and there's nothing they can do about it.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) Representation matters.</s>
 <s id="39">Serena Williams proved to the world that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs.</s>
 <s id="40">Let's celebrate her now.</s>
 <s id="41">Jackie Robinson.</s>
 <s id="42">He broke the color barrier and empowered many black athletes to play in Major League Baseball.</s>
 <s id="43">We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field so that anyone can see him swing for the fences in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.</s>
 <s id="44">With augmented reality, we have the power to tell stories in public spaces that need to be told.</s>
 <s id="45">The achievements of people like Frida Kahlo, Audre Lorde, Toussaint Louverture, Madam C.J. Walker -- this should be common knowledge.</s>
 <s id="46">Our vision is a "Pokémon Go" for a contextualized history.</s>
 <s id="47">Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations that are fighting against systemic oppression.</s>
 <s id="48">In 2019 we will release our free smartphone app with augmented reality monuments and content.</s>
 <s id="49">You can take your smartphone and hold it over any one-dollar bill and see a scene in augmented reality that illustrates the injustice of cash bail.</s>
 <s id="50">You can then click on the screen and be directed to the donation page of The Bail Project, a fund that raises money for people who cannot afford bail.</s>
 <s id="51">With augmented reality, we the people have the power to highlight the narratives of the oppressed when institutions refuse to do so.</s>
 <s id="52">We can use this tool to highlight the systemic implications of erasing someone's history.</s>
 <s id="53">And more concretely, we can use this technology as a way to support initiatives that are fighting against systemic racism.</s>
 <s id="54">With AR, we have the power to reimagine a world that prioritizes justice over oppression.</s>
 <s id="55">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="56">(Applause and cheers)</s>
