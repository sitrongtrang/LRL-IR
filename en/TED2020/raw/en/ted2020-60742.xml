 <s id="1">So what do people usually say when you're about to give a public talk?</s>
 <s id="2">It's to imagine that your audience is naked.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) Well, I'm doing a different trick tonight, and I'm going to imagine all of us without farmers, and well, it's not so much different.</s>
 <s id="4">[Without farmers you'd be hungry, naked and sober] (Laughter) And our farmers do so much more for us than simply feed and clothe and provide us excellent things to drink.</s>
 <s id="5">Our farmers are an important part of all of our communities, particularly our rural communities.</s>
 <s id="6">And more than that, they're a strong driver of resilient economics.</s>
 <s id="7">Think about it this way: When a brewer buys hops from me, grown here in Minnesota, 90 percent of that dollar stays in our state, compared to just 10 percent when they buy it from somewhere else.</s>
 <s id="8">What that means is a lot.</s>
 <s id="9">That 90 percent means local jobs.</s>
 <s id="10">It means tax revenue for better schools and roads.</s>
 <s id="11">It means support for the co-ops, the mechanics, all the support staff that are needed for a farm to thrive.</s>
 <s id="12">And they're our best stewards of the land.</s>
 <s id="13">This quote, I think, exemplifies what our family farmers do for us in stewarding our shared natural resources.</s>
 <s id="14">"That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected as an extension of ethics."</s>
 <s id="15">Now, they sure do a lot of good stuff for us.</s>
 <s id="16">And our family farmers are great, we'd all agree.</s>
 <s id="17">However, the trends in agriculture today are dire.</s>
 <s id="18">The average age of a farmer in America, according to the latest agricultural census -- 58.3.</s>
 <s id="19">Of all the farmers, 33 percent are 65 plus.</s>
 <s id="20">That's a little caricature of my grandpa.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) He's still farming, and he's much older than 65.</s>
 <s id="22">But to put that in perspective, another important public service job, teaching, average age of teachers is 42.</s>
 <s id="23">Our farmers are pretty old in this country.</s>
 <s id="24">And unfortunately, when they retire, if they retire, we're not really replacing them.</s>
 <s id="25">Of all the farmers that we added in this country between 2008 and 2012, across the entire United States -- see if you can catch this difference -- we added 2,000 under the age of 30.</s>
 <s id="26">I'm one of those.</s>
 <s id="27">I'll be around to autograph some photos later, if you'd like.</s>
 <s id="28">(Laughter) But, you know, our farmers are getting older and we're not replacing them -- what's going on here?</s>
 <s id="29">What are we going to do?</s>
 <s id="30">And I think there's a reason folks aren't coming into it, and that's prices.</s>
 <s id="31">We're going to go through a couple of slides like this.</s>
 <s id="32">Milk: This is the average retail price of a gallon of milk in the United States.</s>
 <s id="33">Four dollars forty-nine cents.</s>
 <s id="34">How much do you think the farmer gets?</s>
 <s id="35">Dollar thirty-two.</s>
 <s id="36">We'll try again with bread.</s>
 <s id="37">Average retail price of bread in America, three forty-nine.</s>
 <s id="38">Farmer gets ...</s>
 <s id="39">Twelve cents.</s>
 <s id="40">Audience: Oh!</s>
 <s id="41">And so how are we supposed to have strong local farms in this scenario?</s>
 <s id="42">What are we supposed to do if there aren't any local farmers left?</s>
 <s id="43">And this isn't just a farmer problem, it's not just something for the few of us farmers to sort out.</s>
 <s id="44">This is an all-of-us problem.</s>
 <s id="45">This is rural and it's urban and it's statewide and it's nationwide.</s>
 <s id="46">So what do we do about it?</s>
 <s id="47">I'll tell you that.</s>
 <s id="48">But first, a story.</s>
 <s id="49">The green movement, we're all kind of familiar, started in the '60s, planting trees.</s>
 <s id="50">And now we've come such a long way.</s>
 <s id="51">Green is part of our day-to-day lives.</s>
 <s id="52">It's part of the day-to-day lives of Fortune 500 businesses.</s>
 <s id="53">It's the subject of international treaties, the subject of presidential debates.</s>
 <s id="54">You and I, we switch our light bulbs, we use reusable bags.</s>
 <s id="55">We participate in the green movement each and every day.</s>
 <s id="56">Yet ...</s>
 <s id="57">and this is how we get to the idea -- the food movement, relatively younger, but also somewhat familiar, I imagine.</s>
 <s id="58">You go to the grocery store, you see a sign that says "Buy local," you go to the farmers market, you go to the co-op, you read books by prominent authors.</s>
 <s id="59">The food movement to date could be summarized as voting with your fork.</s>
 <s id="60">The idea is: you pull a dollar out of your wallet -- how you spend that dollar affects the food system.</s>
 <s id="61">It supports farmers close to home.</s>
 <s id="62">And that's all well and good, but where are we going?</s>
 <s id="63">How do we get to our renewable-energy moment like the green movement did?</s>
 <s id="64">And this, I think, is what we need to do.</s>
 <s id="65">Just voting with our fork is not solving the issues that our farmers are facing.</s>
 <s id="66">And so we need to do more than that.</s>
 <s id="67">I believe we must move on from just voting with our fork to voting with our vote.</s>
 <s id="68">We need to take our dollars and continue to spend them locally.</s>
 <s id="69">We also need to show up at the ballot box for our farmers.</s>
 <s id="70">This is bigger than just buying local strawberries once a year at a pick-your-own.</s>
 <s id="71">This is a year-round effort that we must make together to make the change we need.</s>
 <s id="72">Changes like fair pricing for farmers.</s>
 <s id="73">That's quotas, supply management, guaranteed prices.</s>
 <s id="74">Changes like fair and open trade.</s>
 <s id="75">That means ending trade wars.</s>
 <s id="76">And yeah, of course it means voting.</s>
 <s id="77">Now we all knew that one already, though.</s>
 <s id="78">For example, it's working.</s>
 <s id="79">Hey, who's that?</s>
 <s id="80">(Laughter) Just this year in Minnesota, we've passed a historic, first-in-the-country tax credit.</s>
 <s id="81">The Beginning Farmer Tax Credit.</s>
 <s id="82">It incentivizes our transition of land from the existing generation to the next generation.</s>
 <s id="83">That was done by a handful of us young farmers -- we certainly don't have money, you saw that earlier.</s>
 <s id="84">We don't have political experience.</s>
 <s id="85">But we showed up, and we made our voices heard.</s>
 <s id="86">And thanks to the support of farmers and non-farmers alike, we got something incredible done here in this state.</s>
 <s id="87">If we can do it, anybody can do it.</s>
 <s id="88">Now, that was all light and fuzzy and feels pretty happy.</s>
 <s id="89">Skeptics in the audience, you're here.</s>
 <s id="90">That would be me, if I were here.</s>
 <s id="91">Skeptics are thinking, "Wow, what do we need to change about our food system?"</s>
 <s id="92">Farmers are great.</s>
 <s id="93">We have unlimited food, and it's real cheap, too, isn't that great?</s>
 <s id="94">Well, unfortunately, in the '80s and the '90s in this country, we went down a path of policy that could be described as "get big or get out."</s>
 <s id="95">And what "get big or get out" means is you maximize production while minimizing costs.</s>
 <s id="96">On its face value, that sounds pretty simple.</s>
 <s id="97">However, that shift turned our farmers from a venerated class and a valued class in our society into a cost to be minimized.</s>
 <s id="98">That shift made it so that my great-grandfather, who supported the family with six cows, that same dairy, trying to support their family, has to be 600 cows today.</s>
 <s id="99">Six-thousand-cow dairies are not unheard of.</s>
 <s id="100">What happens when there's this one dairy farm in an entire county, where there used to be hundreds?</s>
 <s id="101">The same could be said with corn or beans or field crops.</s>
 <s id="102">What happens when it takes 10,000 acres for one person to support themselves?</s>
 <s id="103">When it used to only take 40.</s>
 <s id="104">We know what happens, we read about it in the news.</s>
 <s id="105">Broadly determined, rural decline, but schools close, schools consolidate, post offices close, grocery stores close.</s>
 <s id="106">People leave, the community suffers and goes away.</s>
 <s id="107">I believe all of us in this audience with ties to rural Minnesota know this story well.</s>
 <s id="108">This is not a problem that we can solve with farmers markets and good intentions.</s>
 <s id="109">We have to do more for our farmers.</s>
 <s id="110">Policy got us into this mess, and policy can get us out.</s>
 <s id="111">American farmers are only getting older, fewer and poorer, yet they are crucial to our state.</s>
 <s id="112">They're the vibrancy in our rural communities.</s>
 <s id="113">They're the drivers of economic growth and stability, and they are our best protectors of our shared resources of land, water and air.</s>
 <s id="114">So we have to do better for them.</s>
 <s id="115">So join me, would you?</s>
 <s id="116">Let's fight for our farmers.</s>
 <s id="117">You can see it, we're already doing it in Minnesota, having great success.</s>
 <s id="118">And together, we can do even more.</s>
 <s id="119">And we must.</s>
 <s id="120">So we were voting with our fork before, and we want to keep doing that.</s>
 <s id="121">But if I could have one idea for you to go home with today, it's vote with your vote.</s>
 <s id="122">And so to that end, on the count of three, I'd like all of us to say it together.</s>
 <s id="123">Are you ready?</s>
 <s id="124">OK, one, two, three.</s>
 <s id="125">Audience: Vote with your vote.</s>
 <s id="126">Very nice, thank you.</s>
 <s id="127">I think you got it.</s>
 <s id="128">(Applause)</s>
