 <s id="1">So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this, or this, or maybe this.</s>
 <s id="2">But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this -- green tea, sugar, a few microbes and a little time.</s>
 <s id="3">I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms, which spin cellulose in a fermentation process.</s>
 <s id="4">Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface.</s>
 <s id="5">So we start by brewing the tea.</s>
 <s id="6">I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.</s>
 <s id="7">We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath.</s>
 <s id="8">We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.</s>
 <s id="9">And then we're ready to add the living organism.</s>
 <s id="10">And along with that, some acetic acid.</s>
 <s id="11">And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.</s>
 <s id="12">We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.</s>
 <s id="13">And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it.</s>
 <s id="14">And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.</s>
 <s id="15">So this is my mini fabric farm.</s>
 <s id="16">After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.</s>
 <s id="17">So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.</s>
 <s id="18">And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.</s>
 <s id="19">So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose.</s>
 <s id="20">And they're sticking together, forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.</s>
 <s id="21">After about two to three weeks, we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.</s>
 <s id="22">So the bath on the left is after five days, and on the right, after 10.</s>
 <s id="23">And this is a static culture.</s>
 <s id="24">You don't have to do anything to it; you just literally watch it grow.</s>
 <s id="25">It doesn't need light.</s>
 <s id="26">And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold, soapy water.</s>
 <s id="27">At this point, it's really heavy.</s>
 <s id="28">It's over 90 percent water, so we need to let that evaporate.</s>
 <s id="29">So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.</s>
 <s id="30">Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.</s>
 <s id="31">And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.</s>
 <s id="32">And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.</s>
 <s id="33">And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams.</s>
 <s id="34">So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.</s>
 <s id="35">I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me.</s>
 <s id="36">Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.</s>
 <s id="37">I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation.</s>
 <s id="38">Using fruit and vegetable staining, create organic patterning.</s>
 <s id="39">And using indigo, make it anti-microbial.</s>
 <s id="40">And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.</s>
 <s id="41">And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one, and a really short one at that.</s>
 <s id="42">What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.</s>
 <s id="43">So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water.</s>
 <s id="44">The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked.</s>
 <s id="45">Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.</s>
 <s id="46">What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need.</s>
 <s id="47">So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.</s>
 <s id="48">Align it in this direction.</s>
 <s id="49">Make it hydrophobic.</s>
 <s id="50">And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape."</s>
 <s id="51">Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing, and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue.</s>
 <s id="52">But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire.</s>
 <s id="53">Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, we could actually imagine growing consumable products.</s>
 <s id="54">What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency.</s>
 <s id="55">So we only grow what we need.</s>
 <s id="56">There's no waste.</s>
 <s id="57">And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant.</s>
 <s id="58">Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.</s>
 <s id="59">What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials.</s>
 <s id="60">But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources.</s>
 <s id="61">Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact.</s>
 <s id="62">We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp, a chair, a car or maybe even a house.</s>
 <s id="63">So I guess what my question to you is: in the future, what would you choose to grow?</s>
 <s id="64">Thank you very much.</s>
 <p id="p65">
  <s id="65.1">(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity, what you're wearing is not random.</s>
  <s id="65.2">(Suzanne Lee: No.)</s>
  <s id="65.3">This is one of the jackets you grew?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="66">SL: Yes, it is.</s>
 <s id="67">It's probably -- part of the project's still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.</s>
 <s id="68">(Laughter) It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.</s>
 <s id="69">BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">Suzanne Lee.</s>
  <s id="70.2">(SL: Thank you.)</s>
