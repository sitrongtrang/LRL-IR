 <s id="1">How many of you have had your doctor ask you about sex?</s>
 <s id="2">Your mental health?</s>
 <s id="3">Alcohol use?</s>
 <s id="4">These questions are almost universal.</s>
 <s id="5">But how many of you have had your doctor ask you about money?</s>
 <s id="6">Most of us haven't.</s>
 <s id="7">But that is strange, because compared to most high-income countries, child poverty is an epidemic in the United States.</s>
 <s id="8">It creates conditions that may elevate stress hormone levels and impair brain development.</s>
 <s id="9">Poor children in the US are one and a half times more likely to die and twice as likely to be hospitalized as their middle-class counterparts.</s>
 <s id="10">So my colleague Dr. Michael Hole and I started asking moms about money.</s>
 <s id="11">We knew we needed to reimagine what a doctor's visit looks like, to get kids out of poverty and to give them a fair shot at a healthy life.</s>
 <s id="12">Our questions led to a surprising solution: tax credits.</s>
 <s id="13">It turns out, the earned income tax credit, or EITC, is the best poverty prescription we have in the US.</s>
 <s id="14">The average mom gets two to three thousand dollars a year from it.</s>
 <s id="15">When families get it, moms and babies are healthier: fewer depressed moms, babies weighing more at birth.</s>
 <s id="16">But one out of five families who could get it doesn't, and most who do lose of hundreds of dollars to the for-profit tax-preparation industry.</s>
 <s id="17">One day, a mom asked us why we couldn't do her taxes while she waited for the doctor.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">(Laughter) We all know that purgatory.</s>
  <s id="18.2">Why not make good use of that time?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">So we started StreetCred, an organization prescribing tax preparation in clinics serving kids.</s>
 <s id="20">This is a brand-new approach and one that left some questioning our sanity.</s>
 <s id="21">After all, we're doctors, not accountants.</s>
 <s id="22">But we have something accountants don't: access to families.</s>
 <s id="23">Over 90 percent of kids in the US see a doctor at least once a year.</s>
 <s id="24">Their parents trust us and will do anything to give them a better life.</s>
 <s id="25">Doctors in every clinic around the country could be doing this work, too -- it's simple, really.</s>
 <s id="26">The hospital registers as a tax-preparation site, and everyone, from medical students to retirees, can volunteer as a tax preparer after passing an IRS exam.</s>
 <s id="27">It's not as hard as it sounds, I promise.</s>
 <s id="28">I certainly never thought I would be doing other people's taxes, but here I am.</s>
 <s id="29">We're nearing the end of our third year.</s>
 <s id="30">In the first two, we returned 1.6 million dollars to 750 families in Boston alone.</s>
 <s id="31">This year -- (Applause) This year, we've expanded to nine sites in four states.</s>
 <s id="32">Sixty-three percent of our families have never heard of the EITC.</s>
 <s id="33">How can you claim something you haven't heard of?</s>
 <s id="34">And half have never used free tax preparation.</s>
 <s id="35">That two to three thousand dollars a year goes a long way.</s>
 <s id="36">Take hunger.</s>
 <s id="37">An adequately nutritious, low-cost diet for a mom and two young kids costs 477 dollars a month.</s>
 <s id="38">With EITC money, that family can eat for five to six months.</s>
 <s id="39">Or think about medical care.</s>
 <s id="40">Twenty million children in the US lack access to care meeting modern pediatric standards.</s>
 <s id="41">And yet, the average cost of that care is only 400 dollars per kid per year.</s>
 <s id="42">EITC money can help fix this access problem.</s>
 <s id="43">Perhaps most powerfully of all, this money gives moms hope.</s>
 <s id="44">One mom used her refund for her son to study abroad in Spain.</s>
 <s id="45">She was struggling to pay her rent, but she saw EITC money as his shot at a better future.</s>
 <s id="46">We have an opportunity, as doctors and as citizens, to get to the root of this problem.</s>
 <s id="47">We can reimagine health care as a place addressing the causes of poor health, be it infections or finances.</s>
 <s id="48">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="49">(Applause)</s>
