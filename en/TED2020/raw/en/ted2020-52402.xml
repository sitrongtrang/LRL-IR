 <s id="1">Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where the Norse Gods made their home.</s>
 <s id="2">There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, anchored itself.</s>
 <s id="3">But though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants and trolls of Jotunheim, who despised the gods and sought to destroy them.</s>
 <s id="4">One day when Thor, strongest of the gods, was off fighting these foes, a stranger appeared, riding a powerful gray horse.</s>
 <s id="5">The visitor made the gods an astonishing offer.</s>
 <s id="6">He would build them the greatest wall they’d ever seen, higher than any giant could climb and stronger than any troll could break.</s>
 <s id="7">All he asked in return was the beautiful goddess Freya’s hand in marriage— along with the sun and moon from the sky.</s>
 <s id="8">The gods balked at this request and were ready to send him away.</s>
 <s id="9">But the trickster Loki concocted a devious plan.</s>
 <s id="10">He told the gods they should accept the stranger’s offer, but set such strict conditions that he would fail to complete the wall in time.</s>
 <s id="11">That way, they would lose nothing, while getting most of the wall built for free.</s>
 <s id="12">Freya didn’t like this idea at all, but Odin and the other gods were convinced and came to an agreement with the builder.</s>
 <s id="13">He would only have one winter to complete the wall.</s>
 <s id="14">If any part was unfinished by the first day of summer, he would receive no payment.</s>
 <s id="15">And he could have no help from any other people.</s>
 <s id="16">The gods sealed the deal with solemn oaths and swore the mason would come to no harm in Asgard.</s>
 <s id="17">In the morning, the stranger began to dig the foundations at an astonishing speed, and at nightfall he set off towards the mountains to obtain the building stones.</s>
 <s id="18">But it was only the next morning, when they saw him returning, that the gods began to worry.</s>
 <s id="19">As agreed, no other people were helping the mason.</s>
 <s id="20">But his horse Svadilfari was hauling a load of stones so massive it left trenches in the ground behind them.</s>
 <s id="21">Winter came and went.</s>
 <s id="22">The stranger kept building, Svadilfari kept hauling, and neither snow nor rain could slow their progress.</s>
 <s id="23">With only three days left until summer, the wall stood high and impenetrable, with only the gate left to be built.</s>
 <s id="24">Horrified, the gods realized that not only would they lose their fertility goddess forever, but without the sun and moon the world would be plunged into eternal darkness.</s>
 <s id="25">They wondered why they’d made such a foolish wager— and then remembered Loki and his terrible advice.</s>
 <s id="26">Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever.</s>
 <s id="27">All of his fellow gods threatened him with an unimaginably painful death if he didn’t find some way to prevent the builder from getting his payment.</s>
 <s id="28">So Loki promised to take care of the situation, and dashed away.</s>
 <s id="29">Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off to retrieve the final load of stones.</s>
 <s id="30">But just as he called Svadilfari to him, a mare appeared in the field.</s>
 <s id="31">She was so beautiful that Svadilfari ignored his master and broke free of his reins.</s>
 <s id="32">The mason tried to catch him, but the mare ran deep into the woods and Svadilfari followed.</s>
 <s id="33">The stranger was furious.</s>
 <s id="34">He knew that the gods were behind this and confronted them: no longer as a mild-mannered mason, but in his true form as a terrifying mountain giant.</s>
 <s id="35">This was a big mistake.</s>
 <s id="36">Thor had just returned to Asgard, and now that the gods knew a giant was in their midst, they disregarded their oaths.</s>
 <s id="37">The only payment the builder would receive— and the last thing he would ever see— was the swing of Thor’s mighty hammer Mjolnir.</s>
 <s id="38">As they set the final stones into the wall, the gods celebrated their victory.</s>
 <s id="39">Loki was not among them, however.</s>
 <s id="40">Several months would pass before he finally returned, followed by a beautiful gray foal with eight legs.</s>
 <s id="41">The foal would grow into a magnificent steed named Sleipnir and become Odin’s mount, a horse that could outrun the wind itself.</s>
 <s id="42">But exactly where he had come from was something Loki preferred not to discuss.</s>
