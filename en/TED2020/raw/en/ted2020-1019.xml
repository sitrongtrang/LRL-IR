 <s id="1">I'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis.</s>
 <s id="2">As a child, I had two passions.</s>
 <s id="3">One was a passion for rodents.</s>
 <s id="4">I had all kinds of rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, squirrels.</s>
 <s id="5">You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) I also had a passion for Africa.</s>
 <s id="7">Growing up in a multicultural environment, we had African students in the house, and I learned about their stories, so different backgrounds, dependency on imported know-how, goods, services, exuberant cultural diversity.</s>
 <s id="8">Africa was truly fascinating for me.</s>
 <s id="9">I became an industrial engineer, engineer in product development, and I focused on appropriate detection technologies, actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries.</s>
 <s id="10">I started working in the industry, but I wasn't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear, extracting and manufacturing mode.</s>
 <s id="11">I quit my job to focus on the real world problem: landmines.</s>
 <s id="12">We're talking '95 now.</s>
 <s id="13">Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development, which is really true.</s>
 <s id="14">As long as these devices are there, or there is suspicion of landmines, you can't really enter into the land.</s>
 <s id="15">Actually, there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they're needed to produce, which is mainly in the developing world.</s>
 <s id="16">We chose rats.</s>
 <s id="17">Why would you choose rats?</s>
 <s id="18">Because, aren't they vermin?</s>
 <s id="19">Well, actually rats are, in contrary to what most people think about them, rats are highly sociable creatures.</s>
 <s id="20">And actually, our product -- what you see here.</s>
 <s id="21">There's a target somewhere here.</s>
 <s id="22">You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.</s>
 <s id="23">There, the animal finds a mine.</s>
 <s id="24">It scratches on the soil.</s>
 <s id="25">And the animal comes back for a food reward.</s>
 <s id="26">Very, very simple.</s>
 <s id="27">Very sustainable in this environment.</s>
 <s id="28">Here, the animal gets its food reward.</s>
 <s id="29">And that's how it works.</s>
 <s id="30">Very, very simple.</s>
 <s id="31">Now why would you use rats?</s>
 <s id="32">Rats have been used since the '50s last century, in all kinds of experiments.</s>
 <s id="33">Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species.</s>
 <s id="34">They're extremely sensitive to smell.</s>
 <s id="35">Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it.</s>
 <s id="36">Now how do we communicate with rats?</s>
 <s id="37">Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.</s>
 <s id="38">A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.</s>
 <s id="39">First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.</s>
 <s id="40">Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.</s>
 <s id="41">Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.</s>
 <s id="42">It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.</s>
 <s id="43">Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets.</s>
 <s id="44">In the next step, animals learn to find real mines in real minefields.</s>
 <s id="45">They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.</s>
 <s id="46">This consists of 400 square meters.</s>
 <s id="47">There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.</s>
 <s id="48">If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.</s>
 <s id="49">Maybe one slight difference: we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog.</s>
 <s id="50">This is our team in Mozambique: one Tanzanian trainer, who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows.</s>
 <s id="51">And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.</s>
 <s id="52">They have a skill, which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid.</s>
 <s id="53">Moreover, this small team together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up.</s>
 <s id="54">But with this small investment in a rat capacity, we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18, and we can still bring that price down.</s>
 <s id="55">Question of scale.</s>
 <s id="56">If you can bring in more rats, we can actually make the output even bigger.</s>
 <s id="57">We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.</s>
 <s id="58">Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology.</s>
 <s id="59">They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region, and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines.</s>
 <s id="60">But let me bring you to a very different problem.</s>
 <s id="61">And there's about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine, but worldwide last year, almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection.</s>
 <s id="62">Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked, there is a huge common problem.</s>
 <s id="63">Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure, reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.</s>
 <s id="64">In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.</s>
 <s id="65">It means that, if you have T.B., you have more chance that you won't be detected, but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.</s>
 <s id="66">And if, however, you are detected very early, diagnosed early, treatment can start, and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.</s>
 <s id="67">You can actually cure T.B., even in HIV-positives.</s>
 <s id="68">So in our common language, Dutch, the name for T.B.</s>
 <s id="69">is "tering," which, etymologically, refers to the smell of tar.</s>
 <s id="70">Already the old Chinese and the Greek, Hippocrates, have actually published, documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients.</s>
 <s id="71">So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals, trained rats on them and see if this works, and wonder, well, we can reach 89 percent sensitivity, 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row.</s>
 <s id="72">This is how it works, and really, this is a generic technology.</s>
 <s id="73">We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis, but can you imagine, you can actually put anything under there.</s>
 <s id="74">So how does it work?</s>
 <s id="75">You have a cassette with 10 samples.</s>
 <s id="76">You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.</s>
 <s id="77">An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.</s>
 <s id="78">Here it's already at the third sample.</s>
 <s id="79">This is a positive sample.</s>
 <s id="80">It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.</s>
 <s id="81">And by doing so, very fast, we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive, which are negative.</s>
 <s id="82">Just as an indication, whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day, a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only.</s>
 <s id="83">A cage like this -- (Applause) A cage like this -- provided that you have rats, and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this, operating throughout the day, can process 1,680 samples.</s>
 <s id="84">Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils, customs applications, detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.</s>
 <s id="85">But let's stick first to tuberculosis.</s>
 <s id="86">I just want to briefly highlight, the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people, where 15,000 reported to get a test done.</s>
 <s id="87">Microscopy for 1,800 patients.</s>
 <s id="88">And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back, we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent.</s>
 <s id="89">Throughout last year, we've been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent.</s>
 <s id="90">So this is really considerable.</s>
 <s id="91">Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people, healthy people, per year, you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives.</s>
 <s id="92">At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.</s>
 <s id="93">The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology.</s>
 <s id="94">And there are simple things like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds.</s>
 <s id="95">So, to standardize this.</s>
 <s id="96">Also, to standardize the pellets, the food rewards, and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people.</s>
 <s id="97">To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.</s>
 <s id="98">Here is a first prototype of our camera rat, which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on.</s>
 <s id="99">This is in a prototype stage.</s>
 <s id="100">We don't have a working system here yet.</s>
 <s id="101">To conclude, I would actually like to say, you may think this is about rats, these projects, but in the end it is about people.</s>
 <s id="102">It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult, expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks, and doing that with a local resource, plenty available.</s>
 <s id="103">So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you, whether they are environmental, technological, animal, or human.</s>
 <s id="104">And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable world.</s>
 <s id="105">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="106">(Applause)</s>
