 <s id="1">The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+.</s>
  <s id="2.2">(Laughter) What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">And I'm gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within, and to follow the TED commandments: that is, actually, something that creates a near-death experience, but near-death is good for creativity.</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) OK.</s>
 <s id="5">So, I also want to explain, because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.</s>
 <s id="6">And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.</s>
 <s id="7">When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily; I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain and the one that's in between that is the censor and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.</s>
 <s id="8">And I'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process, which includes a number of things that happened, actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I'm creating something new.</s>
 <s id="9">And that includes nature, and nurture, and what I refer to as nightmares.</s>
 <s id="10">Now in the nature area, we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something, perhaps in our brains, some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect.</s>
 <s id="11">And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.</s>
 <s id="12">And others, like my mother, would say that I get my material from past lives.</s>
 <s id="13">Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.</s>
 <s id="14">I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic, that he might have had temporal lobe seizures, and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.</s>
 <s id="15">And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago, but it was during the time I was writing my last book, and some people say that book is quite different.</s>
 <s id="16">I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis: you know, who am I, why am I this particular person, why am I not black like everybody else?</s>
 <s id="17">And sometimes you're equipped with skills, but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">I used to draw.</s>
  <s id="18.2">I thought I would be an artist.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">And I had a miniature poodle.</s>
 <s id="20">And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.</s>
 <s id="21">Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.</s>
 <s id="22">And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.</s>
 <s id="23">And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be, and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad, but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words.</s>
 <s id="24">Also, one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma.</s>
 <s id="25">And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had, and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.</s>
 <s id="26">That figure right there, by the way, figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old, and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.</s>
 <s id="27">I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15, this was supposed to be my side occupation, and it led to a sense of failure.</s>
 <s id="28">But actually, there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14.</s>
 <s id="29">And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father, six months later, had brain tumors.</s>
 <s id="30">And my mother believed that something had gone wrong, and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.</s>
 <s id="31">My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles, and that God's will would take care of that.</s>
 <s id="32">But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.</s>
 <s id="33">And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">Everything except randomness.</s>
  <s id="34.2">She did not believe in randomness.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">There was a reason for everything.</s>
 <s id="36">And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother, who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.</s>
 <s id="37">And so, I had this notion of death all around me, because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.</s>
 <s id="38">And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon, you begin to think very much about everything.</s>
 <s id="39">You become very creative, in a survival sense.</s>
 <s id="40">And this, then, led to my big questions.</s>
 <s id="41">And they're the same ones that I have today.</s>
 <s id="42">And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?</s>
 <s id="43">And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?</s>
 <s id="44">It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300, you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen, in what order they happen.</s>
  <s id="45.2">What are the influences?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?</s>
 <s id="47">And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.</s>
 <s id="48">It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe, as the creator of that universe.</s>
 <s id="49">And you see, there's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out -- years and years, oftentimes.</s>
 <s id="50">So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.</s>
 <s id="51">And I got a lot of them during what's been going on throughout this conference, almost everything that's been going on.</s>
 <s id="52">And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.</s>
 <s id="53">So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.</s>
 <s id="54">And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.</s>
 <s id="55">There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">But when you make those associations, you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story, and what you're finding is what matters.</s>
  <s id="56.2">The meaning.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">There is also the uncertainty principle, which is part of quantum mechanics, as I understand it.</s>
  <s id="58.2">(Laughter) And this happens constantly in the writing.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect, in which you're looking for something, and you know, things are happening simultaneously, and you're looking at it in a different way, and you're trying to really look for the about-ness, or what is this story about.</s>
  <s id="59.2">And if you try too hard, then you will only write the about.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">You won't discover anything.</s>
 <s id="61">And what you were supposed to find, what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way, is no longer there.</s>
 <s id="62">Now, I don't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe, like many of our scientists have.</s>
 <s id="63">And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here, and just say that creative people are multidimensional, and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.</s>
 <s id="64">(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.</s>
 <s id="65">There is also a big question of ambiguity.</s>
 <s id="66">And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.</s>
 <s id="67">And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.</s>
 <p id="p68">
  <s id="68.1">And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it.</s>
  <s id="68.2">Moral ambiguity.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">It is constantly there.</s>
  <s id="69.2">And, just as an example, this is one that recently came to me.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq.</s>
  <s id="70.2">And she said, "Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="71">A very famous Chinese saying, she said.</s>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there until things were solved.</s>
  <s id="72.2">You know, maybe even 100 years.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">So, there was another one that I came across, and it's "saving fish from drowning."</s>
 <s id="74">And it's what Buddhist fishermen say, because they're not supposed to kill anything.</s>
 <s id="75">And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.</s>
 <s id="76">So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning, and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.</s>
 <s id="77">Now, what's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation, and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me: "save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."</s>
 <s id="78">And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business, or you're going to get stuck.</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">OK.</s>
  <s id="79.2">I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning, or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.</s>
 <s id="81">And all of us in life, when we see a situation, we have a response.</s>
 <s id="82">And then we have intentions.</s>
 <s id="83">There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do, and then we do something.</s>
 <s id="84">And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">Maybe things go wrong.</s>
  <s id="85.2">And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">What are we supposed to do?</s>
 <s id="87">Do we stay in for life, or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good, and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?</s>
 <s id="88">That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called "Saving Fish From Drowning."</s>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">I saw examples of that.</s>
  <s id="89.2">Once I identified this question, it was all over the place.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="90">I got these hints everywhere.</s>
 <s id="91">And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.</s>
 <p id="p92">
  <s id="92.1">And then writing, that's what happens.</s>
  <s id="92.2">I get these hints, these clues, and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="93">And what I need, in effect, is a focus.</s>
 <s id="94">And when I have the question, it is a focus.</s>
 <s id="95">And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.</s>
 <s id="96">And it seems like it's happening all the time.</s>
 <s id="97">You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity, in which you're getting all this help from the universe.</s>
 <s id="98">And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.</s>
 <s id="99">And you are noticing it more often.</s>
 <s id="100">But you apply this.</s>
 <s id="101">You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.</s>
 <s id="102">Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?</s>
 <s id="103">Why or why not?</s>
 <s id="104">It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said, human rights in Burma.</s>
 <s id="105">I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show that I approved of the military regime there.</s>
 <s id="106">And then, after a while, I had to ask myself, "Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us?"</s>
 <s id="107">And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up, and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father, who was a Baptist minister.</s>
 <s id="108">So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions, and still didn't know that if I went there, what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.</s>
 <s id="109">We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of.</s>
 <s id="110">We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?</s>
 <s id="111">Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals, so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?</s>
 <s id="112">Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at, and we talked about today, is genocide.</s>
 <s id="113">This leads to this question.</s>
 <s id="114">When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable, and I consider what my intentions should be, I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life, and what is my place in the universe?</s>
 <s id="115">It seems so obvious, and yet it is not.</s>
 <s id="116">We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense, and yet it is also absolutely necessary.</s>
 <s id="117">In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.</s>
 <s id="118">Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.</s>
 <s id="119">My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book, because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.</s>
 <s id="120">Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally, from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time, I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself, and that actually was the way it happened.</s>
 <s id="121">And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.</s>
 <s id="122">There are also things, quite uncanny, which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.</s>
 <s id="123">In this case, I was writing a story that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.</s>
 <s id="124">And I needed to find something historically that would match that.</s>
 <s id="125">And I took down this book, and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period, and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion, happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that, and a character who thought he was the son of God.</s>
 <s id="126">You wonder, are these things random chance?</s>
 <p id="p127">
  <s id="127.1">Well, what is random?</s>
  <s id="127.2">What is chance?</s>
  <s id="127.3">What is luck?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="128">What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?</s>
 <s id="129">And that goes into the story, too.</s>
 <s id="130">These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.</s>
 <s id="131">Especially when good things happen, and, in particular, when bad things happen.</s>
 <s id="132">But I do think there's a kind of serendipity, and I do want to know what those elements are, so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.</s>
 <s id="133">Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.</s>
 <s id="134">Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place, and we ended up in this non-tourist location, a beautiful village, pristine.</s>
 <p id="p135">
  <s id="135.1">And we walked three valleys beyond, and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous, a discomfort I felt.</s>
  <s id="135.2">And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="136">And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.</s>
 <s id="137">For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.</s>
 <s id="138">And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.</s>
 <p id="p139">
  <s id="139.1">I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs, that I said, sure.</s>
  <s id="139.2">And about 45 minutes later, walking along the beach, I came across this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="140">And it was a man, a Chinese man, and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.</s>
 <s id="141">And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"</s>
 <s id="142">And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."</s>
 <s id="143">And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.</s>
 <s id="144">I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story, and I cannot explain it.</s>
 <s id="145">Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things?</s>
 <s id="146">Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?</s>
 <s id="147">A big thing that I also think about is accidents.</s>
 <s id="148">And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.</s>
 <s id="149">What is the nature of accidents?</s>
 <s id="150">And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are, outside of a court of law?</s>
 <s id="151">I was able to see that in a firsthand way, when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.</s>
 <p id="p152">
  <s id="152.1">And I saw this beautiful place.</s>
  <s id="152.2">I knew I wanted to come back.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="153">And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China.</s>
 <s id="154">And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.</s>
 <p id="p155">
  <s id="155.1">And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went, there was a terrible accident.</s>
  <s id="155.2">A man, an old man, fell asleep, and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="156">60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.</s>
 <s id="157">Responsibility was assigned to the family.</s>
 <s id="158">The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.</s>
 <p id="p159">
  <s id="159.1">And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident.</s>
  <s id="159.2">That's not fair.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="160">It's the son, not the father."</s>
 <s id="161">When I go on a story, I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs.</s>
 <s id="162">It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.</s>
 <s id="163">And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.</s>
 <p id="p164">
  <s id="164.1">And I began to sense something different about the history, and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village, and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links with other families.</s>
  <s id="164.2">And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p165">
  <s id="165.1">I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years.</s>
  <s id="165.2">And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p166">
  <s id="166.1">Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition.</s>
  <s id="166.2">But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="167">So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.</s>
 <s id="168">Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.</s>
 <p id="p169">
  <s id="169.1">The book comes and it goes.</s>
  <s id="169.2">When it arrives, it is no longer my book.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="170">It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.</s>
 <s id="171">But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?</s>
 <s id="172">And how do I create my own life?</s>
 <s id="173">And I think it is by questioning, and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.</s>
 <s id="174">I believe in specifics, the specifics of story, and the past, the specifics of that past, and what is happening in the story at that point.</s>
 <s id="175">I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents, God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.</s>
 <p id="p176">
  <s id="176.1">I have to think of my role.</s>
  <s id="176.2">Where I am in the universe, and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="177">And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.</s>
 <s id="178">And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.</s>
 <s id="179">And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.</s>
 <s id="180">So, there are never complete answers.</s>
 <s id="181">Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.</s>
 <s id="182">And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me, it is to simply imagine.</s>
 <s id="183">And to imagine is to put myself in that story, until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.</s>
 <s id="184">And that's how I've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think, to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.</s>
 <s id="185">Because for everything, in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.</s>
 <s id="186">I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.</s>
 <s id="187">We've come to the end of the talk, and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse, and it is the things that transform in our lives, that are wonderful and stay with us.</s>
 <s id="188">There she is.</s>
 <s id="189">Thank you very much!</s>
 <s id="190">(Applause)</s>
