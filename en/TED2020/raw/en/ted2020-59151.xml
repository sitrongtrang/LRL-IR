 <s id="1">Hi everybody.</s>
 <s id="2">My name is Matt Cutts, and I worked at Google for almost 17 years.</s>
 <s id="3">As a distinguished engineer there, I was pretty close to the top of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.</s>
 <s id="4">Then I decided to follow some inspiring folks and do a short tour at the US Digital Service.</s>
 <s id="5">That's the group of geeks that helped rescue HealthCare.gov when that website went down hard in 2013.</s>
 <s id="6">Yeah.</s>
 <s id="7">So I signed up for a three-to-six-month tour, and almost three years later, I'm still in Washington DC, working for the federal government, because the government really needs technologists right now.</s>
 <s id="8">At my old job, every room had videoconferencing integrated with calendars, power cables were built right into the furniture.</s>
 <s id="9">When I moved to a government agency, I had to call a person to set up a phone conference.</s>
 <s id="10">And when we moved to a new office, we didn't have furniture for a while, so we set up the phone on a trash can.</s>
 <s id="11">One of the things that surprised me, whenever I moved to DC, is how much the government still has to deal with paper.</s>
 <s id="12">This is a facility in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where people were worried that the building might be structurally unsound from the weight of all that paper.</s>
 <s id="13">Yeah.</s>
 <s id="14">Paper has some downsides.</s>
 <s id="15">Here's a pop quiz: If your last name starts with H or higher, H or higher, would you raise your hand?</s>
 <s id="16">Wow.</s>
 <s id="17">I have some bad news: Your veteran records might have been destroyed in a fire in 1973.</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) Yeah.</s>
 <s id="19">Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors.</s>
 <s id="20">If you're a veteran and you're applying for your health benefits using a paper form, you might have to wait months for that form to be processed.</s>
 <s id="21">We replaced that with a web form, and now most veterans find out if they can get access to their health benefits in 10 minutes.</s>
 <s id="22">(Applause) Here's another launch that I'm proud of.</s>
 <s id="23">We worked with the Small Business Administration to move one of their systems from paper to digital.</s>
 <s id="24">So this is a picture from before, and this is afterwards.</s>
 <s id="25">Same cubicles, same people, just a better system for everyone.</s>
 <s id="26">At one point, we wanted to celebrate modernizing a different system, and so we went to a local grocery store and we said, "Can you make a cake and decorate it with the form that we've digitized?"</s>
 <s id="27">And the grocery store got really weirded out by that request.</s>
 <s id="28">They wanted a letter on official government letterhead.</s>
 <s id="29">Well, we work for the government, so we wrote a letter that said, "You can use this public-domain form on a cake for celebratory purposes."</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake.</s>
 <s id="31">Yes, dad jokes in government.</s>
 <s id="32">Now I've talked a lot about paper, but we also bring up computer systems that go down.</s>
 <s id="33">We bring in modern technology practices, like user-centered design and the cloud, and we also help improve procurement.</s>
 <s id="34">It turns out government buys software the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks: from government regulations that are over 1,000 pages long.</s>
 <s id="35">So yes, there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now.</s>
 <s id="36">But if you think Silicon Valley is the savior in this story, (Laughs) you've got another thing coming.</s>
 <s id="37">Some of the best and brightest minds in technology are working on meal-delivery start-ups and scooters and how to deliver weed to people better.</s>
 <s id="38">Is that really the most important thing to work on right now?</s>
 <s id="39">Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place.</s>
 <s id="40">But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way in government.</s>
 <s id="41">This is somebody whose dad passed away.</s>
 <s id="42">He hunted me down on Twitter to say that a system that we had improved worked well for him during a tough time.</s>
 <s id="43">Those tough times are when government needs to work well and why we need innovation in government.</s>
 <s id="44">Now I have a confession to make.</s>
 <s id="45">When I came to DC, I sometimes used words like bureaucrat.</s>
 <s id="46">These days, I'm much more likely to use words like civil servant.</s>
 <s id="47">Like Francine, who can make you cry.</s>
 <s id="48">Or at least, she made me cry, because she's so inspiring.</s>
 <s id="49">I am also deeply, fiercely proud of my colleagues.</s>
 <s id="50">They will work through illogical situations and put in late nights to get to the right result.</s>
 <s id="51">The government can't pay huge salary bonuses, so we ended up making our own awards.</s>
 <s id="52">Our mascot is a crab named Molly.</s>
 <s id="53">And so that award is actually a crab-shaped purse, screwed into sheet metal.</s>
 <s id="54">These days, I believe less in silver bullets that are going to fix everything.</s>
 <s id="55">I believe more in the people who show up to help.</s>
 <s id="56">If you're looking for something deeply meaningful -- and full disclosure, sometimes incredibly frustrating -- here's what you need to know.</s>
 <s id="57">There is something difficult and messy and vital and magical happening when civil servants partner with technologists at the city and state and national level.</s>
 <s id="58">You don't have to do it forever.</s>
 <s id="59">But you can make a difference in public service right now.</s>
 <s id="60">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="61">(Applause)</s>
