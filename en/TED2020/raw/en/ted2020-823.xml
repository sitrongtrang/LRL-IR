 <s id="1">(Music) ♫ My age is three hundred ♫ ♫ and seventy-two ♫ ♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫ ♫ How I used to pick up and voraciously chew ♫ ♫ the dear little boys that I met ♫ ♫ I've eaten them raw in their holiday suits, ♫ ♫ Eaten them curried with rice, ♫ ♫ I've eaten them baked in their jackets and boots, ♫ ♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫ ♫ But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare, ♫ ♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫ ♫ To do such a thing when I'm quite well aware ♫ ♫ Little boys do not like being chewed. ♫ ♫ Little boys do not like being chewed. ♫ (Music) ♫ So now I contentedly live upon eels, ♫ ♫ And try to do nothing amiss ♫ ♫ And pass all the time I can spare from my meals ♫ ♫ In innocent slumber like this, ♫ ♫ Innocent slumber like this. ♫ (Applause) I suppose I owe you an explanation.</s>
 <s id="2">I've been working on a project for the last six years adapting children's poetry to music.</s>
 <s id="3">And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl, who was a stockbroker in New York City for 45 years, but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.</s>
 <s id="4">And this book was one of the most famous books in America for about 35 years.</s>
 <s id="5">"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang, is one of his poems.</s>
 <s id="6">Now, we're going to do other poems for you, and here's a preview of some of the poets.</s>
 <s id="7">This is Rachel Field, Robert Graves -- a very young Robert Graves -- Christina Rossetti.</s>
 <s id="8">Ghosts, right?</s>
 <s id="9">Have nothing to say to us, obsolete, gone -- not so.</s>
 <s id="10">What I really enjoyed about this project is reviving these people's words.</s>
 <s id="11">Taking them off the dead, flat pages.</s>
 <s id="12">Bringing them to life, bringing them to light.</s>
 <s id="13">So, what we're going to do next is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.</s>
 <s id="14">Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.</s>
 <s id="15">When she was 10 years old in 1927, she published her first book of poems called "The Janitor's Boy."</s>
 <s id="16">Here she is.</s>
 <s id="17">And here's her poem.</s>
 <s id="18">(Music) ♫ Oh, I'm in love with the janitor's boy, ♫ ♫ And the janitor's boy is in love with me. ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm in love with the janitor's boy, ♫ ♫ And the janitor's boy is in love with me. ♫ ♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫ ♫ In our geography. ♫ ♫ A desert isle with spicy trees ♫ ♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫ ♫ A right nice place, just fit for two ♫ ♫ Where we can live always. ♫ ♫ Oh, I'm in love with the janitor's boy, ♫ ♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫ he's busy as can be; ♫ ♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫ ♫ Out of an old settee. ♫ ♫ He'll carry me off, I know that he will, ♫ ♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫ ♫ And the only thing that occurs to me ♫ ♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫ ♫ And on the day that we sail, I will leave a little note ♫ ♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫ ♫ "I have flown to an island in the bay ♫ ♫ With my janitor's red haired-boy." ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ I'm going to sail away ♫ ♫ Gone to Sheepshead Bay ♫ ♫ With my janitor's red-haired boy. ♫ ♫ On an old settee ♫ ♫ My red-haired boy and me ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy. ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ (Applause) The next poem is by E.E. Cummings, "Maggie and Milly and Molly and May."</s>
 <s id="19">(Music) ♫ Maggie and Milly, Molly and May ♫ ♫ They went down to the beach one day to play ♫ ♫ And Maggie discovered a shell that sang ♫ ♫ So sweetly she couldn't remember her troubles ♫ ♫ Maggie and Milly, Molly and May ♫ ♫ Maggie and Milly, Molly and May ♫ ♫ Milly befriended a stranded star ♫ ♫ Whose rays, whose rays ♫ ♫ Five languid fingers were ♫ (Music) ♫ Maggie and Milly, Molly and May ♫ ♫ Maggie and Milly, Molly and May ♫ (Music) ♫ Molly was chased by a horrible thing ♫ ♫ Which raced sideways blowing ♫ ♫ Blowing ♫ ♫ Blowing ♫ ♫ May came home with a smooth, round stone ♫ ♫ Small as a world and as large as alone ♫ (Music) ♫ For whatever we lose like a you or a me ♫ ♫ Always ourselves that we find at the sea ♫ (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="20">(Applause) The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."</s>
 <s id="21">It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.</s>
 <s id="22">She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England.</s>
 <s id="23">He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children.</s>
 <s id="24">One was his daughter, Laurence.</s>
 <s id="25">She wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 1888, and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.</s>
 <s id="26">(Music) ♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫ ♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫ ♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫ ♫ And you know I'm seldom good, seldom good -- ♫ ♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫ ♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫ ♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫ ♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫ ♫ And a pony all my own ♫ ♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫ ♫ That I can take to town. ♫ ♫ And when I'm really getting old -- ♫ ♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫ ♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫ ♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ If no one marries me ♫ ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ ♫ Marries me ♫ ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ ♫ Marries me ♫ ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ Thank you.</s>
 <s id="27">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="28">I became very curious about the poets after spending six years with them, and started to research their lives, and then decided to write a book about it.</s>
 <s id="29">And the burning question about Alma-Tadema was: Did she marry?</s>
 <s id="30">And the answer was no, which I found in the London Times archive.</s>
 <s id="31">She died alone in 1940 in the company of her books and her dear friends.</s>
 <s id="32">Gerard Manley Hopkins, a saintly man.</s>
 <s id="33">He became a Jesuit.</s>
 <s id="34">He converted from his Anglican faith.</s>
 <s id="35">He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement, the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as -- and he became a Jesuit priest.</s>
 <s id="36">He burned all his poetry at the age of 24 and then did not write another poem for at least seven years because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet with the life of a priest.</s>
 <s id="37">He died typhoid fever at the age of 44, I believe, 43 or 44.</s>
 <s id="38">At the time, he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin.</s>
 <s id="39">A few years before he died, after he had resumed writing poetry, but in secret, he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research: "I've written a verse.</s>
 <s id="40">It is to explain death to a child, and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."</s>
 <s id="41">And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he'd written the letter.</s>
 <s id="42">And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."</s>
 <s id="43">♫ Margaret, are you grieving ♫ ♫ Over Goldengrove unleaving, by and by? ♫ ♫ Leaves, like the things of man, you ♫ ♫ With your fresh thoughts care for, can you? ♫ ♫ But as the heart grows older ♫ ♫ It will come to such sights much colder ♫ ♫ By and by, nor spare a sigh ♫ ♫ Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie; ♫ ♫ And yet you will weep and you'll know why. ♫ ♫ No matter child, the name: ♫ ♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫ ♫ They're all the same. ♫ ♫ Nor mouth had nor no mind expressed ♫ ♫ What heart heard of, ghost had guessed: ♫ ♫ It's the blight man was born for, ♫ ♫ It is Margaret that you mourn for ♫ Thank you so much.</s>
 <s id="44">(Applause) (Music) I'd like to thank everybody, all the scientists, the philosophers, the architects, the inventors, the biologists, the botanists, the artists ...</s>
 <s id="45">everyone that blew my mind this week.</s>
 <s id="46">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="47">(Applause) ♫ Oh, a li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la la la la la la ♫ (Applause) ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la la la ♫ ♫ La la la li la la la la la ♫ ♫ You've been so kind and generous ♫ ♫ I don't know how you keep on giving. ♫ ♫ And for your kindness, I'm in debt to you. ♫ ♫ And for your selflessness, my admiration. ♫ ♫ And for everything you've done, you know I'm bound; ♫ ♫ I'm bound to thank for it ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la la ♫ (Clapping) ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la ♫ ♫ La li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la ♫ ♫ And you ♫ ♫ Now you've been so kind and ... ♫ Curb the enthusiasm, just a little bit.</s>

  <s id="48.2">(Laughter) It's my turn.</s>

 <s id="49">I still have two minutes.</s>
 <s id="50">(Laughter) Okay, we're going to start that verse again.</s>

 <p id="p52">
  <s id="52.1">Calming the audience down; I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy, and I, "That's enough.</s>

  <s id="52.4">(Laughter) I have so much admiration for him.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="53">♫ Now, you've been so kind and generous, ♫ ♫ I don't know how you keep on giving. ♫ ♫ And for your kindness I'm in debt to you. ♫ ♫ And I never could have come this far without you. ♫ ♫ So for everything you've done, you know I'm bound ♫ ♫ I'm bound to thank you for it ♫ (Clapping) ♫ La li la la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la li la li la la la ♫ ♫ La li la la la ♫ ♫ Oh, I want to thank you for so many gifts ♫ ♫ You gave in love with tenderness ♫ ♫ Thank you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you for your generosity ♫ ♫ the love and the honesty that you gave me ♫ ♫ I want to thank you show my gratitude, ♫ My love and my respect for you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you, thank you ♫ ♫ Thank you, thank you ♫ ♫ Thank you, thank you ♫ ♫ Thank you, thank you ♫ ♫ I want to thank you, thank you ♫ ♫ Thank you, thank you ♫ You know what?</s>
