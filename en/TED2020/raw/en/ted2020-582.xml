 <s id="1">I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time, in a very short time.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">Video: All right, start the clock please.</s>
  <s id="2.2">30 seconds studio.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">Keep it quiet please.</s>
  <s id="3.2">Settle down.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">It's about time.</s>
  <s id="4.2">End sequence.</s>
  <s id="4.3">Take one.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">15 seconds studio.</s>
 <s id="6">10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two ...</s>
 <s id="7">Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam's temptation.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy.</s>
  <s id="8.2">Take a bite."</s>
  <s id="8.3">"I did."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">"One bite, Adam.</s>
  <s id="9.2">Don't abandon Eve."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">"I don't know, guys.</s>
 <s id="11">I don't want to get in trouble."</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">"Okay.</s>
  <s id="12.2">One bite.</s>
  <s id="12.3">What the hell?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">(Laughter) Life is temptation.</s>
  <s id="13.2">It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.</s>
 <s id="15">Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.</s>
 <s id="16">And most of them did so without using birth control.</s>
 <s id="17">So much for promises.</s>
 <s id="18">Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.</s>
 <p id="p19">
  <s id="19.1">They can have one marshmallow now.</s>
  <s id="19.2">But if they wait until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="20">Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.</s>
 <s id="21">What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">They cannot wait.</s>
  <s id="22.2">The others, of course, wait.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p23">
  <s id="23.1">They resist the temptation.</s>
  <s id="23.2">They delay the now for later.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="24">Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford, went back 14 years later, to try to discover what was different about those kids.</s>
 <s id="25">There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded, in many ways.</s>
 <s id="26">The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">That's enormous.</s>
  <s id="27.2">That's like a whole set of different IQ points.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">They didn't get in as much trouble.</s>
  <s id="28.2">They were better students.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">They were self-confident and determined.</s>
  <s id="29.2">And the key for me today, the key for you, is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">So what is time perspective?</s>
  <s id="30.2">That's what I'm going to talk about today.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">Time perspective is the study of how individuals, all of us, divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories.</s>
 <s id="32">And you do it automatically and non-consciously.</s>
 <s id="33">They vary between cultures, between nations, between individuals, between social classes, between education levels.</s>
 <s id="34">And the problem is that they can become biased, because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.</s>
 <s id="35">What determines any decision you make?</s>
 <s id="36">You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.</s>
 <s id="37">For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation, what other people are doing and what you're feeling.</s>
 <s id="38">And those people, when they make their decisions in that format -- we're going to call them "present-oriented," because their focus is what is now.</s>
 <s id="39">For others, the present is irrelevant.</s>
 <s id="40">It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"</s>
 <s id="41">So that their decisions are based on past memories.</s>
 <s id="42">And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.</s>
 <s id="43">For others it's not the past, it's not the present, it's only about the future.</s>
 <s id="44">Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.</s>
 <s id="45">Cost-benefit analysis.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">We're going to call them "future-oriented."</s>
  <s id="46.2">Their focus is on what will be.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">So, time paradox, I want to argue, the paradox of time perspective, is something that influences every decision you make, you're totally unaware of.</s>
 <s id="48">Namely, the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Well there is actually six of them.</s>
  <s id="49.2">There are two ways to be present-oriented.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.</s>
 <s id="51">You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.</s>
 <s id="52">You can be present-hedonistic, namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist -- it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.</s>
 <s id="53">You can be future-oriented, setting goals.</s>
 <s id="54">Or you can be transcendental future: namely, life begins after death.</s>
 <s id="55">Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation, that's what you've got to learn to do.</s>
 <s id="56">So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?</s>
 <p id="p57">
  <s id="57.1">High on past-positive.</s>
  <s id="57.2">Moderately high on future.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="58">And moderate on present-hedonism.</s>
 <s id="59">And always low on past-negative and present-fatalism.</s>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots.</s>
  <s id="60.2">You connect your family, identity and your self.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="61">What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations, new challenges.</s>
 <s id="62">What you get from the present hedonism is the energy, the energy to explore yourself, places, people, sensuality.</s>
 <s id="63">Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.</s>
 <s id="64">What do futures sacrifice for success?</s>
 <p id="p65">
  <s id="65.1">They sacrifice family time.</s>
  <s id="65.2">They sacrifice friend time.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">They sacrifice fun time.</s>
  <s id="66.2">They sacrifice personal indulgence.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">They sacrifice hobbies.</s>
  <s id="67.2">And they sacrifice sleep.</s>
  <s id="67.3">So it affects their health.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">And they live for work, achievement and control.</s>
 <s id="69">I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">(Laughter) And it resonated for me.</s>
  <s id="70.2">I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto, a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="71">I'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.</s>
 <s id="72">Told me don't eat that marshmallow, because if you wait you're going to get two of them, until I learned to balance out.</s>
 <s id="73">I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive, so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive, and I'm happier than I have ever been.</s>
 <s id="74">I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems: changing the drop-out rates of school kids, combating addictions, enhancing teen health, curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation, reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate, altering appeals to suicidal terrorists, and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.</s>
 <s id="75">So I want to end by saying: many of life's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others.</s>
 <s id="76">And the idea is so simple, so obvious, but I think the consequences are really profound.</s>
 <s id="77">Thank you so much.</s>
 <s id="78">(Applause)</s>
