 <s id="1">I'm passionate about insects for two reasons.</s>
 <s id="2">For one, I'm mad about the infinite diversity of this kind of little beings.</s>
 <s id="3">30 million; not of insects but of species.</s>
 <s id="4">We say that humans invented the wheel.</s>
 <s id="5">But dung beetles would move balls of dung way before we would even think of standing up straight.</s>
 <s id="6">"Humans invented compost."</s>
 <s id="7">Ants would make compost long before any ecologist would in their balcony.</s>
 <s id="8">And just in case you used to think that we have invented air conditioning you are absolutely wrong.</s>
 <s id="9">Of course, termites did it before.</s>
 <s id="10">And there are bugs that serve as thermometers.</s>
 <s id="11">Here you are: the crickets.</s>
 <s id="12">The more they crick, the higher the ambient temperature.</s>
 <s id="13">It obviously varies with the species, but it's quite accurate.</s>
 <s id="14">And these are just some facts about four insects.</s>
 <s id="15">Figure this multiplied by 30 million!</s>
 <s id="16">Incredible!</s>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) Besides, insects are delicious.</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) And this is the second thing I wanted to talk to you about.</s>
 <s id="19">(Applause) When I was 11 years old, I was eating a hamburger at a fast food restaurant when a kid approaches me and says: "Do you know that hamburgers are made of insects?"</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">Hold on for a second!</s>
  <s id="20.2">Are insects edible?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">I later found out that the hamburgers thing was a myth but at the time it kept me wondering and I started searching.</s>
 <s id="22">And in effect, not only insects are edible but they have a lot of advantages to them.</s>
 <s id="23">Compared specially with agriculture and the livestock industry, they create more food in less space and using less natural resources.</s>
 <s id="24">A grass-fed cow needs, give or take one hectare to move.</s>
 <s id="25">Whereas insects don't need more place than what they already take.</s>
 <s id="26">Now, if you feed that cow 8 kg of food, it will generate 1 kg of meat; approximately an 8-to-1 ratio.</s>
 <s id="27">If I feed the 8 kg of food to insects they will generate 4 kg: a 8-to-4 ratio.</s>
 <s id="28">Besides, insects in general have more protein per 100 g than cows.</s>
 <s id="29">For instance, crickets have 22 percent more protein.</s>
 <s id="30">And if this was not enough, the livestock industry is responsible for the release of 37 percent methane due to human activities that contributes to the greenhouse effect.</s>
 <s id="31">And, guess what?</s>
 <s id="32">Insects create in between 10 and 100 time less methane than, say, pork.</s>
 <s id="33">Great, well, but if insects are so cool why don't we have them in the market shelves?</s>
 <s id="34">Precisely, for the faces I saw in most of you when I ate a cricket.</s>
 <s id="35">We don't have it in mind here, but in the world today, 2 billion people eat insects on daily basis.</s>
 <s id="36">As Latinamericans we used to as well, until not so long ago -- Our pre-Columbian diet was made of an important variety of insects: ant larvae, worms, crickets, etc.</s>
 <s id="37">Until the Spaniards came in and put the same face you just put.</s>
 <s id="38">Probably, when you think about eating an insect, you will imagine yourselves biting a cockroach like this or cutting with your knife a tarantula this big, but you need not to worry.</s>
 <s id="39">A product that's becoming widespread is insect flour.</s>
 <s id="40">It has all the benefits I mentioned before plus, you don't even realize you are eating crickets in a slice of bread.</s>
 <s id="41">So, how can we get the most of what insects can give to us?</s>
 <s id="42">In 2017, we went to Chile with a group of friends.</s>
 <s id="43">We attended the first Latinamerican Summit for Young Leaders in Biotech.</s>
 <s id="44">There we introduced and idea I think it can work.</s>
 <s id="45">We suggested creating insects to produce food with added value in urban areas as a way to solve the problem of the lack of space and the cost of resources.</s>
 <s id="46">We did this thinking that if we youngsters don't tear down cultural barriers, nobody will do it.</s>
 <s id="47">In fact, we are already doing this regarding genders.</s>
 <s id="48">And also in Latinamerica the production of food is a neural part of our economy and we cannot stay behind amidst these changes.</s>
 <s id="49">And to do this it's not required a huge warehouse or a big investment.</s>
 <s id="50">For instance, I try to contribute in my own house breeding insects, studying how to cook them and transform them so they can be more edible.</s>
 <s id="51">And if they look at insects beyond our preconceptions?</s>
 <s id="52">What if we see them as thermometers, or as great inventors, and also as food?</s>
 <s id="53">Nature provides with a solution that is profitable, viable and sustainable.</s>
 <s id="54">And it's even delicious!</s>
 <s id="55">Let's grab this chance and try to change the lens we look to insects with.</s>
 <s id="56">(Applause)</s>
