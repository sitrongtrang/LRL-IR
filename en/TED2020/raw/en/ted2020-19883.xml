 <s id="1">You know me.</s>
 <s id="2">I am in your friendship circle hidden in plain sight.</s>
 <s id="3">My clothes are still impeccable -- bought in the good years when I was still making money.</s>
 <s id="4">To look at me you would not know that my electricity was cut off last week for nonpayment, or that I meet the eligibility requirements for food stamps.</s>
 <s id="5">But if you paid attention, you would see that sadness in my eyes -- hear that hint of fear in my otherwise self-assured voice.</s>
 <s id="6">These days I'm buying the $1.99 trial-size jug of Tide to make ends meet.</s>
 <s id="7">I bet you didn't know laundry detergent came in that size.</s>
 <s id="8">You invite me to the same expensive restaurants the two of us have always enjoyed, but I order mineral water now with a twist of lemon, not the 12-dollar glass of chardonnay.</s>
 <s id="9">I am frugal in my menu choices.</s>
 <s id="10">Meticulous, I count every penny in my head.</s>
 <s id="11">I demur dividing the table bill evenly to cover desserts and designer coffees and second and third glasses of wine I did not consume.</s>
 <s id="12">I am tired of trying to fake appearances.</s>
 <s id="13">A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.</s>
 <s id="14">I live without cable, my gym membership and nail appointments.</s>
 <s id="15">I've discovered I can do my own hair.</s>
 <s id="16">There is no retirement savings, no nest egg.</s>
 <s id="17">I exhausted that long ago.</s>
 <s id="18">There is no expensive condo to draw equity and no husband to back me up.</s>
 <s id="19">Months of slow pay and no pay have decimated my credit.</s>
 <s id="20">Bill collectors call constantly, reading verbatim from a script before expressing polite sympathy for my plight and then demanding payment arrangements I can't possibly meet.</s>
 <s id="21">Friends wonder privately how someone so well educated could be in economic free fall.</s>
 <s id="22">I'm still as talented as ever and smart as a whip, but work is sketchy now, mostly on and off consulting gigs.</s>
 <s id="23">At 55 I've learned how to fake cheeriness, but there are not many opportunities for work anymore.</s>
 <s id="24">I don't remember exactly when it stopped, but I cannot deny now having entered the uncertain world of formerly and used to be.</s>
 <s id="25">I'm not sure anymore where I belong.</s>
 <s id="26">What I do know is that dozens of online job applications seem to just disappear into a black hole.</s>
 <s id="27">I'm wondering what is to become of me.</s>
 <s id="28">So far my health has held up, but my body aches -- or is it my spirit?</s>
 <s id="29">Homeless women used to be invisible to me but I appraise them now with curious eyes, wondering if their stories started like mine.</s>
 <s id="30">I wrote this piece a year ago.</s>
 <s id="31">It's a composite of my story and other women I know.</s>
 <s id="32">I wrote it because I was tired of pretending I was all right when I wasn't.</s>
 <s id="33">I was tired of faking normal.</s>
 <s id="34">I wasn't seeing myself in the popular press.</s>
 <s id="35">Nobody I knew was traveling the world or buying a condo in Costa Rica.</s>
 <s id="36">Very few of my friends had set aside the 15 to 20 percent experts tell us we need to maintain our standard of living in retirement.</s>
 <s id="37">My friends, many in their 50s and 60s, were looking at a downward mobility, a work-for-life proposition, just a job loss, medical diagnosis or divorce away from insolvency.</s>
 <s id="38">We may not have hit rock bottom, but many of us saw a sequence of events where rock bottom was possible for the first time.</s>
 <s id="39">And the truth is, it really doesn't take much.</s>
 <s id="40">The median household in the US only has enough savings to replace one month of income.</s>
 <s id="41">Forty-seven percent of us cannot pull together 400 dollars to deal with an emergency.</s>
 <s id="42">That's almost half of us.</s>
 <s id="43">A major car repair and we're standing on the abyss.</s>
 <s id="44">You wouldn't know it to look around you -- I'm not the only one in this situation.</s>
 <s id="45">There are people in this room who are in the same predicament, and if it's not you, it is your parents or your sister or maybe your best friend.</s>
 <s id="46">We get good at faking normal.</s>
 <s id="47">Shame keeps us silent and siloed.</s>
 <s id="48">When I first decided I was going to come out with my story, I did a website and a friend noticed that there were no photos of me -- it was all kind of cartoons like this.</s>
 <s id="49">Even as I was coming out, I was still hiding.</s>
 <s id="50">We live in a world where success is defined by income.</s>
 <s id="51">When you say that you have money problems, you're announcing pretty much that you're a loser.</s>
 <s id="52">When you're a graduate of Harvard Business School as I am, you're some kind of double loser.</s>
 <s id="53">We boomers hear a lot about how we have underfunded our retirement; how it's all our fault.</s>
 <s id="54">Why on earth would we draw down our 401(k) plan to cover the shortfall on our mother-in-law's nursing home care, or to pay for our kid's tuition, or just to survive?</s>
 <s id="55">We're accused of being poor planners and deadbeats -- all that money we spent on lattes and bottled water.</s>
 <s id="56">To shame and blame is so deliciously tempting.</s>
 <s id="57">Many of us don't even wait for others to do it we're so busy doing it to ourselves.</s>
 <s id="58">I say let's own our part: we all could have saved more.</s>
 <s id="59">I know I could have saved more, and if you were to rifle through my life over the last 30 years, you would see more than one dumb thing I have done financially.</s>
 <s id="60">I can't change that now and neither can you, but let's not mix up individual, isolated behavior with the systemic factors that have caused a 7.7-trillion-dollar retirement income gap.</s>
 <s id="61">Millions of boomer-age Americans did not land here because of too many trips to Starbucks.</s>
 <s id="62">We spent the last three decades dealing with flat and falling wages and disappearing pensions and through-the-roof cost on housing and health care and education.</s>
 <s id="63">It used to not be like this.</s>
 <s id="64">We all remember the three-legged retirement income stool which had the savings and pension and social security.</s>
 <s id="65">Well, that stool has gone wobbly.</s>
 <s id="66">Take savings -- what savings?</s>
 <s id="67">For many families, there's just nothing left to save after the bills have been paid.</s>
 <s id="68">The pension leg of the stool has also gone wobbly.</s>
 <s id="69">We can remember when many people had pensions.</s>
 <s id="70">Today only 13 percent of American workers are employed by companies that offer them.</s>
 <s id="71">So what did we get instead?</s>
 <s id="72">We got 401(k)-type plans and suddenly responsibility for retirement planning got shifted from our companies to us.</s>
 <s id="73">We got the reigns but we also got the risk, and it turns out that millions of us just aren't that good at voluntarily investing over 40 years.</s>
 <s id="74">Millions of us just aren't that good at managing market risk.</s>
 <s id="75">And really the numbers tell the story.</s>
 <s id="76">Half of all American households have no retirement savings at all.</s>
 <s id="77">That would be zero.</s>
 <s id="78">No 401(k), no IRA, not a dime.</s>
 <s id="79">Among 55-to-64-year-olds who do have a retirement account, the median value of that account is 104,000 dollars.</s>
 <s id="80">Now, 104,000 dollars does sound better than zero, but as an annuity, it generates about 300 dollars.</s>
 <s id="81">I don't have to tell you that you can't live on that.</s>
 <s id="82">With savings down, pensions becoming a relic of the past and 401(k) plans failing millions of Americans, many near-retirees are dependent on social security as their retirement plan.</s>
 <s id="83">But here's the problem.</s>
 <s id="84">Social security was never supposed to be the retirement plan.</s>
 <s id="85">It's not nearly enough.</s>
 <s id="86">At best it replaces something like 40 percent of your pre-retirement income.</s>
 <s id="87">Things have changed a lot from when social security was introduced back in 1935.</s>
 <s id="88">Then, a 21-year-old male had a 50 percent chance of living until he was 65.</s>
 <s id="89">So he retired at 60, did a little fishing, kissed his grandkids, got his gold watch -- he'd be dead within five years of receiving benefits.</s>
 <s id="90">That's not the pattern today.</s>
 <s id="91">If you're in your late 50s and in good health, you're going to live easily another 20 or 25 years.</s>
 <s id="92">That's a really long time to make ends meet if you are broke.</s>
 <s id="93">So what's the play if you've landed here and you're 50 or 55 or 60?</s>
 <s id="94">What's the play if you don't want to land here and you're 22 or 32?</s>
 <s id="95">Here's what I've learned from my own experience.</s>
 <s id="96">The cavalry's not coming.</s>
 <s id="97">There is no big rescue, no prince charming, no big bailout in the works.</s>
 <s id="98">To have a shot at something other than being old and poor in America, we're going to have to save ourselves and each other.</s>
 <s id="99">I've had to come out of the shadows, stand here openly, and I'm inviting you to do so as well.</s>
 <s id="100">I'm not going to tell you that it's not easy.</s>
 <s id="101">I ventured though to tell my story because I thought it would make it a little easier for people to tell theirs.</s>
 <s id="102">I think it's only through our strength in numbers that we can begin to change the national "la-la" conversation that we are having on this retirement crisis.</s>
 <s id="103">With so many of us shell-shocked and adrift about what has happened to us, we're going to have to build up from the grassroots, forming what I think are resilience circles.</s>
 <s id="104">These are small groups of people coming together to talk about what has happened to them, to share resources and information and to begin to figure out a way forward.</s>
 <s id="105">I believe from this base that we can find our voices again and sound the alarm -- start pushing our institutions and policymakers to go hard on this retirement crisis with the urgency it deserves.</s>
 <s id="106">In the meantime -- and there is an "in the meantime" -- we're going to have to adopt a live-low-to-the-ground mindset, drastically cutting back on our expenses.</s>
 <s id="107">And I don't mean just living within our means.</s>
 <s id="108">A lot of people are already doing that.</s>
 <s id="109">What is called for now is to, in a much deeper way, ask ourselves what it really means to live a life that is not defined by things.</s>
 <s id="110">I call it "smalling up."</s>
 <s id="111">Smalling up is figuring out what you really need to feel contented and grounded.</s>
 <s id="112">I have a friend who drives really beat-up, raggedy cars, but he will scrimp and save 15,000 dollars at one point to buy a flute because music is what really matters to him.</s>
 <s id="113">He smalled up.</s>
 <s id="114">I've had to also let go of magical thinking -- this idea that if I just was patient enough and tightened my belt that things would go back to normal.</s>
 <s id="115">If I just sent in one more CV or applied to one more job online or attended one more networking event that surely I'd get the kind of job I was used to having.</s>
 <s id="116">Surely things would return to normal.</s>
 <s id="117">The truth is I'm not going back and neither are you.</s>
 <s id="118">The normal that we knew is over.</s>
 <s id="119">In this new place that we are, we're going to be asked to do things that we don't want to do.</s>
 <s id="120">We're going to be asked to take assignments that we think are beneath our station and our talent and our skill.</s>
 <s id="121">I have had to get off my throne.</s>
 <s id="122">Last year, a good friend of mine asked me if I would help her with some organization work.</s>
 <s id="123">I assumed she meant community organizing along the lines of what President Obama did in Chicago.</s>
 <s id="124">She meant organizing somebody's closet.</s>
 <s id="125">I said, "I'm not doing that."</s>
 <p id="p126">
  <s id="126.1">She said, "Get off your throne.</s>
  <s id="126.2">Money is green."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="127">It's not easy being part of the advance team that is ushering in this new era of work and living.</s>
 <s id="128">First is always hardest.</s>
 <s id="129">First is before there are networks and pathways and role models ...</s>
 <s id="130">before there are policies and ways to show us how to go forward.</s>
 <s id="131">We're in the middle of a seismic shift, and we're going to have to find bridgework to get us through.</s>
 <s id="132">Bridgework is what we do in the meantime; bridgework is what we do while we're trying to figure out what is next.</s>
 <s id="133">Bridgework is also letting go of this notion that our worth and our value depend on our income and our titles and our jobs.</s>
 <s id="134">Bridgework can look crazy or cool depending on how you were rolling when your personal financial crisis hit.</s>
 <s id="135">I have friends with PhDs who are working at the Container Store or driving Uber or Lyft, and then I have other friends who are partnering with other boomers and doing really cool entrepreneurial ventures.</s>
 <s id="136">Bridgework doesn't mean that we don't want to build on our past careers, that we don't want meaningful work.</s>
 <s id="137">We do.</s>
 <s id="138">Bridgework is what we do in the meantime while we're figuring out what is next.</s>
 <s id="139">I've also learned to think strategy not failure when I'm sort of processing all these things that I don't want to do.</s>
 <s id="140">And I say that that's an approach that I would invite you to consider as well.</s>
 <s id="141">So if you need to move in with your brother to make ends meet, call him.</s>
 <s id="142">If you need to take in a boarder to help you pay your mortgage or pay your rent, do it.</s>
 <s id="143">If you need to get food stamps, get the darn food stamps.</s>
 <s id="144">AARP says only a third of older adults who are eligible actually get them.</s>
 <s id="145">Do what you need to do to go another round.</s>
 <s id="146">Know that there are millions of us.</s>
 <s id="147">Come out of the shadows.</s>
 <s id="148">Cut back, small up; think strategy, not failure; get off your throne and find the bridgework to get your through the lean times.</s>
 <s id="149">As a country, we have achieved longevity, investing billions of dollars in the diagnosis, treatment and management of disease.</s>
 <s id="150">It's not enough to just live a long time.</s>
 <s id="151">We want to live well.</s>
 <s id="152">We haven't invested nearly as much in the physical infrastructure to ensure that that happens.</s>
 <s id="153">We need now a new way of thinking about what it means to be old in America.</s>
 <s id="154">And we need guidance and ideas about how to live a richly textured life on a much more modest income.</s>
 <s id="155">So I am calling on change agents and social entrepreneurs, artists and elders and impact investors.</s>
 <s id="156">I'm calling on developers and disrupters of the status quo.</s>
 <s id="157">We need you to help us imagine how to invest in the services and products and infrastructure that will support our dignity, our independence and our well-being in these many, many decades that we're going to live.</s>
 <s id="158">My journey has taken me from a place of fear and shame to one of humility and understanding.</s>
 <s id="159">I'm ready now to link shields with others, to fight this fight, and I'm inviting you to join me.</s>
 <s id="160">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="161">(Applause)</s>
