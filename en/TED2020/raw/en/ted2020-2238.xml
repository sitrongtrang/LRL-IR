 <s id="1">These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.</s>
 <s id="2">They're bizzarre, they're beautiful, and there's very little we know about them.</s>
 <s id="3">These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.</s>
 <s id="4">I was about five years old at the time, and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist.</s>
 <s id="5">Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world.</s>
 <s id="6">And now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara.</s>
 <s id="7">I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus.</s>
 <s id="8">A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.</s>
 <s id="9">Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II.</s>
 <s id="10">So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes.</s>
 <s id="11">From these drawings, we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big, it had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail, and it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile, with conical teeth, that may have been used to catch slippery prey, like fish.</s>
 <s id="12">But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years.</s>
 <s id="13">My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria, a place called the Kem Kem.</s>
 <s id="14">It's a difficult place to work in.</s>
 <s id="15">You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions, and it's very difficult to find good fossils there.</s>
 <s id="16">But our hard work paid off.</s>
 <s id="17">We discovered many incredible specimens.</s>
 <s id="18">There's the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.</s>
 <s id="19">We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs, and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters.</s>
 <s id="20">These fossils were deposited in a river system.</s>
 <s id="21">The river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth, a monster sawfish, and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles.</s>
 <s id="22">It was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine.</s>
 <s id="23">So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus, but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive.</s>
 <s id="24">We were just finding bits and pieces and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point.</s>
 <s id="25">Finally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus.</s>
 <s id="26">We returned to the site, we collected more bones.</s>
 <s id="27">And so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature.</s>
 <s id="28">And we were able to reconstruct it.</s>
 <s id="29">We now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile, very different from other predatory dinosaurs, very different from the T. rex.</s>
 <s id="30">But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.</s>
 <s id="31">We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail.</s>
 <s id="32">We had leg bones, we had skull bones, we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet -- again, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this -- and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment, or maybe for paddling in the water.</s>
 <s id="33">We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact.</s>
 <s id="34">Again, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water, it's useful for buoyancy control in the water.</s>
 <s id="35">We C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.</s>
 <s id="36">And when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other.</s>
 <s id="37">It's bigger than a T. rex, and yes, the head has "fish-eating" written all over it, but really the entire skeleton has "water-loving" written all over it -- dense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size, and again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water.</s>
 <s id="38">So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus -- I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin -- we realize that we're dealing with a river monster, a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants, feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on.</s>
 <s id="39">So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery.</s>
 <s id="40">It's a dinosaur like no other.</s>
 <s id="41">And some people told me, "Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.</s>
 <s id="42">There are not many things left to discover in the world."</s>
 <s id="43">Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth.</s>
 <s id="44">I think the Sahara's still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said, "Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner -- and the world is still full of corners."</s>
 <s id="45">That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines.</s>
 <s id="46">And it is still true today.</s>
 <s id="47">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="48">(Applause)</s>
