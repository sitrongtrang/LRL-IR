 <s id="1">If you were to take any everyday object, say a coffee cup, and break it in half, then in half again, and keep carrying on, where would you end up?</s>
 <s id="2">Could you keep on going forever?</s>
 <s id="3">Or would you find a set of indivisible building blocks out of which everything is made?</s>
 <s id="4">Physicists have found the latter- that matter is made of fundamental particles, the smallest things in the universe.</s>
 <s id="5">Particles interact with each other according to a theory called the “Standard Model”.</s>
 <s id="6">The Standard Model is a remarkably elegant encapsulation of the strange quantum world of indivisible, infinitely small particles.</s>
 <s id="7">It also covers the forces that govern how particles move, interact, and bind together to give shape to the world around us.</s>
 <s id="8">So how does it work?</s>
 <s id="9">Zooming in on the fragments of the cup, we see molecules, made of atoms bound up together.</s>
 <s id="10">A molecule is the smallest unit of any chemical compound.</s>
 <s id="11">An atom is the smallest unit of any element in the periodic table.</s>
 <s id="12">But the atom is not the smallest unit of matter.</s>
 <s id="13">Experiments found that each atom has a tiny, dense nucleus, surrounded by a cloud of even tinier electrons.</s>
 <s id="14">The electron is, as far as we know, one of the fundamental, indivisible building blocks of the universe.</s>
 <s id="15">It was the first Standard Model particle ever discovered.</s>
 <s id="16">Electrons are bound to an atom’s nucleus by electromagnetism.</s>
 <s id="17">They attract each other by exchanging particles called photons, which are quanta of light that carry the electromagnetic force, one of the fundamental forces of the Standard Model.</s>
 <s id="18">The nucleus has more secrets to reveal, as it contains protons and neutrons.</s>
 <s id="19">Though once thought to be fundamental particles on their own, in 1968 physicists found that protons and neutrons are actually made of quarks, which are indivisible.</s>
 <s id="20">A proton contains two “up” quarks and one “down” quark.</s>
 <s id="21">A neutron contains two down quarks and one up.</s>
 <s id="22">The nucleus is held together by the strong force, another fundamental force of the Standard Model.</s>
 <s id="23">Just as photons carry the electromagnetic force, particles called gluons carry the strong force.</s>
 <s id="24">Electrons, together with up and down quarks, seem to be all we need to build atoms and therefore describe normal matter.</s>
 <s id="25">However, high energy experiments reveal that there are actually six quarks– down &amp;amp; up, strange &amp;amp; charm, and bottom &amp;amp; top - and they come in a wide range of masses.</s>
 <s id="26">The same was found for electrons, which have heavier siblings called the muon and the tau.</s>
 <s id="27">Why are there three (and only three) different versions of each of these particles?</s>
 <s id="28">This remains a mystery.</s>
 <s id="29">These heavy particles are only produced, for very brief moments, in high energy collisions, and are not seen in everyday life.</s>
 <s id="30">This is because they decay very quickly into the lighter particles.</s>
 <s id="31">Such decays involve the exchange of force-carrying particles, called the W and Z, which – unlike the photon – have mass.</s>
 <s id="32">They carry the weak force, the final force of the Standard Model.</s>
 <s id="33">This same force allows protons and neutrons to transform into each other, a vital part of the fusion interactions that drive the Sun.</s>
 <s id="34">To observe the W and Z directly, we needed the high energy collisions provided by particle accelerators.</s>
 <s id="35">There’s another kind of Standard Model particle, called neutrinos.</s>
 <s id="36">These only interact with other particles through the weak force.</s>
 <s id="37">Trillions of neutrinos, many generated by the sun, fly through us every second.</s>
 <s id="38">Measurements of weak interactions found that there are different kinds of neutrinos associated with the electron, muon, and tau.</s>
 <s id="39">All these particles also have antimatter versions, which have the opposite charge but are otherwise identical.</s>
 <s id="40">Matter and antimatter particles are produced in pairs in high-energy collisions, and they annihilate each other when they meet.</s>
 <s id="41">The final particle of the Standard Model is the Higgs boson – a quantum ripple in the background energy field of the universe.</s>
 <s id="42">Interacting with this field is how all the fundamental matter particles acquire mass, according to the Standard Model.</s>
 <s id="43">The ATLAS Experiment on the Large Hadron Collider is studying the Standard Model in-depth.</s>
 <s id="44">By taking precise measurements of the particles and forces that make up the universe, ATLAS physicists can look for answers to mysteries not explained by the Standard Model.</s>
 <s id="45">For example, how does gravity fit in?</s>
 <s id="46">What is the real relationship between force carriers and matter particles?</s>
 <s id="47">How can we describe “Dark Matter”, which makes up most of the mass in the universe but remains unaccounted for?</s>
 <s id="48">While the Standard Model provides a beautiful explanation for the world around us, there is still a universe’s worth of mysteries left to explore.</s>
