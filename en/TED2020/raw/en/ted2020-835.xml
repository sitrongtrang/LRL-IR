 <s id="1">Good morning.</s>
 <s id="2">Happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces.</s>
 <s id="3">I have a very peculiar background, attitude and approach to the real world because I am a conjurer.</s>
 <s id="4">Now, I prefer that term over magician, because if I were a magician, that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer, who is someone who pretends to be a real magician.</s>
  <s id="5.2">(Laughter) Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">We depend on the fact that audiences, such as yourselves, will make assumptions.</s>
 <s id="7">For example, when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on, you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) As a matter of fact, this is something that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.</s>
 <s id="9">It's a beard trimmer, you see?</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">And it makes a very bad microphone; I've tried it many times.</s>
  <s id="10.2">(Laughter) The other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">Not only that you can, but that you will when they are properly suggested to you.</s>
 <s id="12">You believe I'm looking at you.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Wrong.</s>
  <s id="13.2">I'm not looking at you.</s>
  <s id="13.3">I can't see you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.</s>
 <s id="15">I know you're there because I can hear you, but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">These are not glasses, these are empty frames.</s>
  <s id="16.2">(Laughter) Quite empty frames.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">Now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face?</s>
 <s id="18">To fool you, ladies and gentlemen, to deceive you, to show that you, too, can make assumptions.</s>
 <s id="19">Don't you ever forget that.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses so I can actually see you, which would probably be a convenience.</s>
  <s id="20.2">I don't know.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">I haven't had a good look.</s>
  <s id="21.2">Well, it's not that great a convenience.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) I have to do something now, which seems a little bit strange for a magician.</s>
 <s id="23">But I'm going to take some medication.</s>
 <s id="24">This is a full bottle of Calms Forte.</s>
 <s id="25">I'll explain that in just a moment.</s>
 <s id="26">Ignore the instructions, that's what the government has to put in there to confuse you, I'm sure.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">I will take enough of these.</s>
  <s id="27.2">Mm.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">Indeed, the whole container.</s>
 <s id="29">Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.</s>
 <s id="30">Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment -- I must tell you that I am an actor.</s>
 <s id="31">I'm an actor who plays a specific part.</s>
 <s id="32">I play the part of a magician, a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.</s>
 <s id="33">If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet, you would be insulted and rightly so.</s>
 <s id="34">Why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this?</s>
 <s id="35">But there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic, magical powers that they can predict the future, that they can make contact with the deceased.</s>
 <s id="36">Oh, they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods.</s>
 <s id="37">Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.</s>
 <s id="38">And they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems.</s>
 <s id="39">They claim to be psychics, or sensitives, whatever they can.</s>
 <s id="40">But the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">Now, to my innocent mind, dead implies incapable of communicating.</s>
  <s id="41.2">(Laughter) You might agree with me on that.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">But these people, they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- "Hi, there" -- but they can hear the dead as well, and they can relay this information back to the living.</s>
 <s id="43">I wonder if that's true.</s>
 <s id="44">I don't think so, because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do, exactly the same -- the same physical methods, the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth, to their detriment.</s>
 <s id="45">They deceive these people, costs them a lot of money, cost them a lot of emotional anguish.</s>
 <s id="46">Billions of dollars are spent every year, all over the globe, on these charlatans.</s>
 <s id="47">Now, I have two questions I would like to ask these people if I had the opportunity to do so.</s>
 <s id="48">First question: If I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">They listen to the spirits like this -- I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because, when she died, she had the family will, and she secreted it someplace.</s>
  <s id="49.2">We don't know where it is, so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">What does Granny say?</s>
  <s id="50.2">She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends, and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.</s>
 <s id="52">And I love you, and I'll always be with you.</s>
 <s id="53">Good bye."</s>
 <s id="54">And she didn't answer the damn question!</s>
 <s id="55">Where is the will?</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">Now, she could easily have said, "Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia," but she doesn't say that.</s>
  <s id="56.2">No, she doesn't.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">She doesn't bring any useful information to us.</s>
 <s id="58">We paid a lot of money for that information, be we didn't get it.</s>
 <s id="59">The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple: Suppose I ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.</s>
 <s id="60">Why do they insist on saying -- remember, they speak into this ear -- why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"</s>
 <s id="61">Is this a hunting game?</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">Hunting and fishing?</s>
  <s id="62.2">What is it?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">Is it 20 questions?</s>
  <s id="63.2">No, it's more like 120 questions.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="64">But it is a cruel, vicious, absolutely conscienceless -- I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) -- game that these people play.</s>
 <s id="65">And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive, the grieving, the needy people out there.</s>
 <s id="66">Now, this is a process that is called cold reading.</s>
 <s id="67">There's one fellow out there, Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.</s>
 <s id="68">He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.</s>
 <s id="69">John Edward, Sylvia Browne and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.</s>
 <s id="70">There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country, James Van Praagh is very big.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And what does he do?</s>
  <s id="71.2">He likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased, the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says, "He tells me, he tells me, before he passed, that he had trouble breathing."</s>
 <s id="73">Folks, that's what dying is all about!</s>
 <s id="74">(Laughter) You stop breathing, and then you're dead.</s>
 <s id="75">It's that simple.</s>
 <s id="76">And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?</s>
 <s id="77">I don't think so.</s>
 <s id="78">Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like, "Why am I getting electricity?</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'</s>
  <s id="79.2">Was he an electrician?"</s>
  <s id="79.3">"No."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p80">
  <s id="80.1">"Did he ever have an electric razor?"</s>
  <s id="80.2">"No."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="81">It was a game of hunting questions like this.</s>
 <s id="82">This is what they go through.</s>
 <s id="83">Now, folks often ask us at the James Randi Educational Foundation, they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?</s>
 <s id="84">Isn't it just a lot of fun?"</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">No, it is not fun.</s>
  <s id="85.2">It is a cruel farce.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort, but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so.</s>
 <s id="87">And then the people look in the mirror, and they say, I just paid a lot of money for that reading.</s>
 <p id="p88">
  <s id="88.1">And what did she say to me?</s>
  <s id="88.2">'I love you!'"</s>
  <s id="88.3">They always say that.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="89">They don't get any information, they don't get any value for what they spend.</s>
 <s id="90">Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.</s>
 <s id="91">We call her "The Talons."</s>
 <s id="92">Sylvia Browne -- thank you -- Sylvia Browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment.</s>
 <s id="93">Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone, she doesn't even go there in person, and you have to wait up to two years because she's booked ahead that amount of time.</s>
 <s id="94">You pay by credit card or whatever, and then she will call you sometime in the next two years.</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">You can tell it's her.</s>
  <s id="95.2">"Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="96">That's her, you can tell right away.</s>
 <s id="97">Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.</s>
 <s id="98">We all know who he is on television.</s>
 <s id="99">He's well educated, he's smart, he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing but he doesn't give a damn.</s>
 <s id="100">He just doesn't care.</s>
 <s id="101">Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it, and he will expose her to television publicity all the time.</s>
 <s id="102">Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?</s>
 <s id="103">She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.</s>
 <p id="p104">
  <s id="104.1">Now, without that, how could we possibly function?</s>
  <s id="104.2">(Laughter) She gives you the names of previous lives, who you were in previous lives.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="105">Duh.</s>
 <s id="106">It turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.</s>
 <s id="107">And the men were all Grecian warriors fighting with Agamemnon.</s>
 <s id="108">Nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London who died of consumption.</s>
 <s id="109">He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.</s>
 <s id="110">And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.</s>
 <p id="p111">
  <s id="111.1">You see these folks on television -- they never call anybody back from hell.</s>
  <s id="111.2">(Laughter) Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">If they call back any of my friends, they're not going to...</s>
  <s id="112.2">Well, you see the story.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception, an exception in one way, because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation, offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.</s>
 <s id="114">Very simply won.</s>
 <s id="115">All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions.</s>
 <s id="116">It's very easy, win the million dollars.</s>
 <s id="117">Sylvia Browne is an exception in that she's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge.</s>
 <s id="118">She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN six and a half years ago.</s>
 <p id="p119">
  <s id="119.1">And we haven't heard from her since.</s>
  <s id="119.2">Strange.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="120">She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.</s>
 <s id="121">Duh.</s>
 <s id="122">A professional psychic who speaks to dead people, she can't reach me?</s>
 <s id="123">(Laughter) I'm alive, you may have noticed.</s>
 <s id="124">Well, pretty well anyway.</s>
 <p id="p125">
  <s id="125.1">She couldn't reach me.</s>
  <s id="125.2">Now she says she doesn't want to reach me because I'm a godless person.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="126">All the more reason to take the million dollars, wouldn't you think, Sylvia?</s>
 <s id="127">Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.</s>
 <s id="128">They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.</s>
 <s id="129">We get people coming to the foundation all the time.</s>
 <s id="130">They're ruined financially and emotionally because they've given their money and their faith to these people.</s>
 <s id="131">Now, I popped some pills earlier.</s>
 <s id="132">I have to explain that to you.</s>
 <s id="133">Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.</s>
 <p id="p134">
  <s id="134.1">Hmm.</s>
  <s id="134.2">You've heard of it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="135">It's an alternative form of healing, right?</s>
 <s id="136">Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.</s>
 <p id="p137">
  <s id="137.1">This is Calms Forte, 32 caplets of sleeping pills!</s>
  <s id="137.2">I forgot to tell you that.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="138">I just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.</s>
 <s id="139">(Laughter) Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.</s>
 <s id="140">It says right on the back here, "In case of overdose, contact your poison control center immediately," and it gives an 800 number.</s>
 <s id="141">Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.</s>
 <s id="142">I don't really need it because I've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years, taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.</s>
 <s id="143">Why don't they affect me?</s>
 <s id="144">(Laughter) (Applause) The answer may surprise you.</s>
 <s id="145">What is homeopathy?</s>
 <s id="146">It's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond Avogadro's limit.</s>
 <p id="p147">
  <s id="147.1">Diluting it down to the point where there's none of it left.</s>
  <s id="147.2">(Laughter) Now folks, this is not just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="148">It's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet, throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe, and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick, and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous.</s>
 <s id="149">Then, when you get a headache, you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.</s>
 <p id="p150">
  <s id="150.1">(Laughter) Now that is true.</s>
  <s id="150.2">That is what homeopathy is all about.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="151">And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is, they say, the more powerful it is.</s>
 <s id="152">Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.</s>
 <s id="153">The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.</s>
 <s id="154">He died of an overdose.</s>
 <s id="155">He forgot to take his pill.</s>
 <p id="p156">
  <s id="156.1">(Laughter) Work on it.</s>
  <s id="156.2">Work on it.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p157">
  <s id="157.1">It's a ridiculous thing.</s>
  <s id="157.2">It is absolutely ridiculous.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="158">I don't know what we're doing, believing in all this nonsense over all these years.</s>
 <s id="159">Now, let me tell you, The James Randi Educational Foundation is waving this very big carrot, but I must say, the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.</s>
 <s id="160">They might, some place out there.</s>
 <s id="161">Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.</s>
 <s id="162">Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.</s>
 <s id="163">You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone -- that's more than lawyers make!</s>
 <s id="164">I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.</s>
 <s id="165">These people don't need the million dollars perhaps, but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it just to make me look silly?</s>
 <s id="166">Just to get rid of this godless person out there that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?</s>
 <s id="167">I think that something needs to be done about this.</s>
 <s id="168">We really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal, state and local authorities to get them to do something.</s>
 <s id="169">If you find out -- now I understand.</s>
 <s id="170">We've seen people, even today, speaking to us about AIDS epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.</s>
 <s id="171">Those are very important, critically important to us.</s>
 <s id="172">And we must do something about those problems.</s>
 <s id="173">But at the same time, as Arthur C. Clarke said, The rotting of the human mind, the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural -- all of this total nonsense, this medieval thinking -- I think something should be done about that, and it all lies in education.</s>
 <s id="174">Largely, it's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing.</s>
 <s id="175">They shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors.</s>
 <s id="176">It's the bottom line, the dollar line.</s>
 <s id="177">That's what they're looking at.</s>
 <s id="178">We really must do something about this.</s>
 <s id="179">I'm willing to take your suggestions, and I'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage.</s>
 <s id="180">It's www.randi.org.</s>
 <s id="181">Go in there and look at the archives, and you will begin to understand much more of what I've been talking about today.</s>
 <s id="182">You will see the records that we have.</s>
 <s id="183">There's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.</s>
 <s id="184">She cashed in the CDs, she gave away the stocks and the certificates.</s>
 <s id="185">That's really sad to hear, and it hasn't helped them one bit, hasn't solved any of their problems.</s>
 <s id="186">Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind, and of the minds all the way around the earth, if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.</s>
 <s id="187">Now, we've offered this carrot, as I say, we've dangled the carrot.</s>
 <s id="188">We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.</s>
 <s id="189">Oh, we get lots of them, hundreds of them every year come by.</s>
 <s id="190">These are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well, but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate their own so-called powers.</s>
 <s id="191">The professionals never come near us, except in that case of Sylvia Browne that I told you about a moment ago.</s>
 <s id="192">She did accept and then backed away.</s>
 <s id="193">Ladies and gentlemen, I'm James Randi, and I'm waiting.</s>
 <s id="194">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="195">(Applause)</s>
