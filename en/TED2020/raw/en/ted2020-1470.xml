 <s id="1">I collaborate with bacteria.</s>
 <s id="2">And I'm about to show you some stop-motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over the period of an hour.</s>
 <s id="3">So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing, and as they do so they create an electrical charge.</s>
 <s id="4">And this attracts metals from their local environment.</s>
 <s id="5">And these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria.</s>
 <s id="6">One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water.</s>
 <s id="7">And the desalination process is one where we take out salts.</s>
 <s id="8">We can use it for drinking and agriculture.</s>
 <s id="9">Removing the salts from water -- particularly seawater -- through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe.</s>
 <s id="10">So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane-filtration technology.</s>
 <s id="11">We take the water from the sea and we apply pressure.</s>
 <s id="12">And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane.</s>
 <s id="13">This takes energy, producing clean water.</s>
 <s id="14">But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.</s>
 <s id="15">But the process is very expensive and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.</s>
 <s id="16">And also, the brine that's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.</s>
 <s id="17">And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.</s>
 <s id="18">So I work in Singapore at the moment, and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology.</s>
 <s id="19">And Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [900] million liters per day of desalinated water.</s>
 <s id="20">But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine.</s>
 <s id="21">And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.</s>
 <s id="22">So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium, potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine.</s>
 <s id="23">And this, in terms of magnesium and the amount of water that I just mentioned, equates to a $4.5 billion mining industry for Singapore -- a place that doesn't have any natural resources.</s>
 <s id="24">So I'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before; imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the Earth; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine.</s>
 <s id="25">And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube, a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.</s>
 <s id="26">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="27">(Applause)</s>
