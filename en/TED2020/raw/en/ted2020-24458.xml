 <s id="1">Trillions of bacteria, viruses, and fungi live on or inside of us, and maintaining a good, balanced relationship with them is to our advantage.</s>
 <s id="2">Together, they form the gut microbiome, a rich ecosystem that performs a variety of functions in our bodies.</s>
 <s id="3">The bacteria in our guts can break down food the body can't digest, produce important nutrients, regulate the immune system, and protect against harmful germs.</s>
 <s id="4">We don't yet have the blueprint for exactly which good bacteria a robust gut needs, but we do know that it's important for a healthy microbiome to have a variety of bacterial species.</s>
 <s id="5">Many factors affect our microbiomes, including our environment, medications like antibiotics, and even whether we were delivered by C-section or not.</s>
 <s id="6">Diet, too, is emerging as one of the leading influences on the health of our guts.</s>
 <s id="7">And while we can't control all these factors, we can manipulate the balance of our microbes by paying attention to what we eat.</s>
 <s id="8">Dietary fiber from foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria.</s>
 <s id="9">When bacteria digest fiber, they produce short chain fatty acids that nourish the gut barrier, improve immune function, and can help prevent inflammation, which reduces the risk of cancer.</s>
 <s id="10">And the more fiber you ingest, the more fiber-digesting bacteria colonize your gut.</s>
 <s id="11">In a recent study, scientists exchanged the regular high-fiber diets of a group of rural South Africans with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets of a group of African-Americans.</s>
 <s id="12">After just two weeks on the high-fat, low-fiber, Western-style diet, the rural African group showed increased inflammation of the colon, as well as a decrease of butyrate.</s>
 <s id="13">That's a short chain fatty acid thought to lower risk of colon cancer.</s>
 <s id="14">Meanwhile, the group that switched to a high-fiber, low-fat diet had the opposite result.</s>
 <s id="15">So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria when we eat low-fiber processed foods?</s>
 <s id="16">Lower fiber means less fuel for the gut bacteria, essentially starving them until they die off.</s>
 <s id="17">This results in less diversity and hungry bacteria.</s>
 <s id="18">In fact, some can even start to feed on the mucus lining.</s>
 <s id="19">We also know that specific foods can affect gut bacteria.</s>
 <s id="20">In one recent microbiome study, scientists found that fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, red wine, and dark chocolate were correlated with increased bacterial diversity.</s>
 <s id="21">These foods contain polyphenols, which are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds.</s>
 <s id="22">On the other hand, foods high in dairy fat, like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas were correlated with decreased diversity.</s>
 <s id="23">How food is prepared also matters.</s>
 <s id="24">Minimally processed, fresh foods generally have more fiber and provide better fuel.</s>
 <s id="25">So lightly steamed, saut√©ed, or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial than fried dishes.</s>
 <s id="26">There are also ways of preparing food that can actually introduce good bacteria, also known as probiotics, into your gut.</s>
 <s id="27">Fermented foods are teeming with helpful probiotic bacteria, like lactobacillus and bifidobacteria.</s>
 <s id="28">Originally used as a way of preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration, fermentation remains a traditional practice all over the world.</s>
 <s id="29">Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha provide variety and vitality to our diets.</s>
 <s id="30">Yogurt is another fermented food that can introduce helpful bacteria into our guts.</s>
 <s id="31">That doesn't necessarily mean that all yogurt is good for us, though.</s>
 <s id="32">Brands with too much sugar and not enough bacteria may not actually help.</s>
 <s id="33">These are just general guidelines.</s>
 <s id="34">More research is needed before we fully understand exactly how any of these foods interact with our microbiomes.</s>
 <s id="35">We see positive correlations, but the insides of our guts are difficult places to make direct observations.</s>
 <s id="36">For instance, we don't currently know whether these foods are directly responsible for the changes in diversity, or if something more complicated is happening.</s>
 <s id="37">While we're only beginning to explore the vast wilderness inside our guts, we already have a glimpse of how crucial our microbiomes are for digestive health.</s>
 <s id="38">The great news is we have the power to fire up the bacteria in our bellies.</s>
 <s id="39">Fill up on fibers, fresh and fermented foods, and you can trust your gut to keep you going strong.</s>
