 <s id="1">Nina Dølvik Brochmann: We grew up believing that the hymen is a proof of virginity.</s>
 <s id="2">But it turns out, we were wrong.</s>
 <s id="3">What we discovered is that the popular story we're told about female virginity is based on two anatomical myths.</s>
 <s id="4">The truth has been known in medical communities for over 100 years, yet somehow these two myths continue to make life difficult for women around the world.</s>
 <s id="5">Ellen Støkken Dahl: The first myth is about blood.</s>
 <s id="6">It tells us that the hymen breaks and bleeds the first time a woman has vaginal sex.</s>
 <s id="7">In other words, if there is no blood on the sheets afterwards, then the woman was simply not a virgin.</s>
 <s id="8">The second myth is a logical consequence of the first.</s>
 <s id="9">Since the hymen is thought to break and bleed, people also believe that it actually disappears or is in some way radically altered during a woman's first intercourse.</s>
 <s id="10">If that were true, one would easily be able to determine if a woman is a virgin or not by examining her genitals, by doing a virginity check.</s>
 <s id="11">NDB: So that's our two myths: virgins bleed, and hymens are lost forever.</s>
 <s id="12">Now, this may sound like a minor issue to you.</s>
 <s id="13">Why should you care about an obscure little skin fold on the female body?</s>
 <s id="14">But the truth is, this is about so much more than an anatomical misunderstanding.</s>
 <s id="15">The myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural significance.</s>
 <s id="16">They have been used as a powerful tool in the effort to control women's sexuality in about every culture, religion and historical decade.</s>
 <s id="17">Women are still mistrusted, shamed, harmed and, in the worst cases, subjected to honor killings if they don't bleed on their wedding night.</s>
 <s id="18">Other women are forced through degrading virginity checks, simply to obtain a job, to save their reputation or to get married.</s>
 <s id="19">ESD: Like in Indonesia, where women are systematically examined to enter military service.</s>
 <s id="20">After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011, a group of female protesters were forced to undergo virginity checks by their military.</s>
 <s id="21">In Oslo, doctors are examining the hymens of young girls to reassure parents that their children are not ruined.</s>
 <s id="22">And sadly, the list goes on.</s>
 <s id="23">Women are so afraid not to live up to the myths about the hymen that they choose to use different virginity quick fixes to assure a bleeding.</s>
 <s id="24">That could be plastic surgery, known as "revirgination," it could be vials of blood poured on the sheets after sex or fake hymens bought online, complete with theater blood and a promise to "kiss your deep, dark secret goodbye."</s>
 <s id="25">NDB: By telling girls that no deed can be kept secret, that their bodies will reveal them no matter what, we have endowed them with fear.</s>
 <s id="26">Girls are afraid of ruining themselves, either through sport, play, tampon use or a sexual activity.</s>
 <s id="27">We have curtailed their opportunities and their freedoms.</s>
 <s id="28">It's time we put an end to the virginity fraud.</s>
 <s id="29">It's time we break the myths about the hymen once and for all.</s>
 <s id="30">ESD: We are medical students, sexual health workers and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under."</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) That's a popular science book about the female genitals.</s>
 <s id="32">And in our experience, people seem to believe that the hymen is some kind of a seal covering the vaginal opening.</s>
 <s id="33">In Norwegian, it is even called "the virgin membrane."</s>
 <s id="34">And with this, we picture something fragile, something easily destructible, something you can rip through, perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping.</s>
 <s id="35">You may have wondered why we brought a hula hoop onstage today.</s>
 <s id="36">We'll show you.</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) Now, it is very hard to hide that something has happened to this hoop, right?</s>
 <s id="38">It is different before and after I punched it.</s>
 <s id="39">The seal is broken, and unless we change the plastic, it won't get back to its intact state.</s>
 <s id="40">So if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here, right now, that would be very easy.</s>
 <s id="41">It's easy to say that this hoop is not a virgin anymore.</s>
 <s id="42">(Laughter) NDB: But the hymen is nothing like a piece of plastic you can wrap around your food, or a seal.</s>
 <s id="43">In fact ...</s>
 <s id="44">it's more like this -- a scrunchie or a rubber band.</s>
 <s id="45">The hymen is a rim of tissue at the outer opening of the vagina.</s>
 <s id="46">And usually, it has a doughnut or a half-moon shape with a large, central hole.</s>
 <s id="47">But this varies a lot, and sometimes hymens can have fringes, it can have several holes, or it can consist of lobes.</s>
 <s id="48">In other words, hymens naturally vary a lot in looks, and that is what makes it so hard to do a virginity check.</s>
 <s id="49">ESD: Now that we know a bit more about the hymen's anatomy, it's time to get back to our two myths: virgins bleed, hymens are lost forever.</s>
 <s id="50">But the hymen doesn't have to break at all.</s>
 <s id="51">The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks.</s>
 <s id="52">And you can stretch a scrunchie, right?</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) You can stretch a hymen, too.</s>
 <s id="54">In fact, it's very elastic.</s>
 <s id="55">And for a lot of women, the hymen will be elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.</s>
 <s id="56">For other women, the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis, but that won't make it disappear.</s>
 <s id="57">But it may look a bit different from before.</s>
 <s id="58">It naturally follows that you can't examine the hymen to check for virginity status.</s>
 <s id="59">This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906 by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet.</s>
 <s id="60">She examined a middle-aged sex worker and concluded that her genitalia were reminiscent of a teenage virgin.</s>
 <s id="61">But that makes sense, right?</s>
 <s id="62">Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex, then what were we expecting to see?</s>
 <s id="63">ESD: Since hymens come in every shape and form, it is difficult to know if a dent or a fold in it is there because of previous damage or if it's just a normal anatomical variant.</s>
 <s id="64">The absurdity of virgin testing is illustrated in a study done on 36 pregnant teenagers.</s>
 <s id="65">When doctors examined their hymens, they could only find clear signs of penetration in two out of the 36 girls.</s>
 <s id="66">So unless you believe in 34 cases of virgin births -- (Laughter) we must all agree that also our second myth has taken a vital blow.</s>
 <s id="67">You simply cannot look a woman between her legs and read her sexual story.</s>
 <s id="68">NDB: Like most myths, the myths about the hymen are untrue.</s>
 <s id="69">There is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex, and half of virgins can easily have sex without bleeding.</s>
 <s id="70">We wish we could say that by removing these myths, everything would be OK, that shame, harm and honor killings would all just disappear.</s>
 <s id="71">But of course, it's not that simple.</s>
 <s id="72">Sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen.</s>
 <s id="73">It's a question of cultural and religious control of women's sexuality.</s>
 <s id="74">And that is much harder to change.</s>
 <s id="75">But we must try.</s>
 <s id="76">ESD: As medical professionals, this is our contribution.</s>
 <s id="77">We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know what the hymen is and how it works.</s>
 <s id="78">We want them to know that the hymen can't be used as a proof of virginity.</s>
 <s id="79">And that way, we can remove one of the most powerful tools used to control young women today.</s>
 <s id="80">After telling you this, you may wonder what the alternative is, for if we cannot use the hymen as a proof of virginity for women, then what should we use?</s>
 <s id="81">We opt for using nothing.</s>
 <s id="82">(Cheering) If you -- (Applause) If you really want to know if a woman is a virgin or not, ask her.</s>
 <s id="83">(Laughter) But how she answers that question is her choice.</s>
 <s id="84">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="85">(Applause)</s>
