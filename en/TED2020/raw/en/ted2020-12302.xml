 <s id="1">June 13, 2014 started as a routine Friday in Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.</s>
 <s id="2">Redemption is the largest free public health hospital in the city.</s>
 <s id="3">We are called upon to serve hundreds of thousands of people.</s>
 <s id="4">In the best of times it puts strain on our resources.</s>
 <s id="5">Monthly supplies run out within weeks, and patients without beds would be seated in chairs.</s>
 <s id="6">That summer, we had a nurse who had been sick for a while.</s>
 <s id="7">Sick enough to be admitted in our hospital.</s>
 <s id="8">But our treatment didn't seem to be helping her; her symptoms were getting worse: diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, fever and weakness.</s>
 <s id="9">On that particular Friday, she developed severe respiratory distress, and her eyes were menacingly red.</s>
 <s id="10">One of my fellow doctors, a general surgeon, became suspicious of her condition.</s>
 <s id="11">He said her symptoms were suggestive of Ebola.</s>
 <s id="12">We kept a close watch on her, we tried to help her.</s>
 <s id="13">We were treating her for malaria, typhoid and gastroenteritis.</s>
 <s id="14">We didn't know it, but by then it was too late.</s>
 <s id="15">The next morning I walked in to check on my patient.</s>
 <s id="16">I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was filled with fear.</s>
 <s id="17">I gave her reassurance, but shortly after ...</s>
 <s id="18">she died of Ebola.</s>
 <s id="19">For me, her death was very personal.</s>
 <s id="20">But this was just the beginning.</s>
 <s id="21">A virtual biological bomb had exploded.</s>
 <s id="22">But the word spread faster than the virus, and panic spread across the hospital.</s>
 <s id="23">All the patients ran away.</s>
 <s id="24">Then, all the nurses and doctors ran away.</s>
 <s id="25">This was the beginning of our medical tsunami -- the devastating Ebola virus that left an indelible scar in our country's history.</s>
 <s id="26">I was not trained for this.</s>
 <s id="27">I had just graduated from medical school two years before.</s>
 <s id="28">At this time, my total knowledge about Ebola came from a one-page article I had read in medical school.</s>
 <s id="29">I perceived the disease as so dangerous, this one page in essence had convinced me to run out of the hospital, too, the moment I heard of a case of Ebola.</s>
 <s id="30">But when it finally happened, I stayed on and decided to help.</s>
 <s id="31">And so did several other brave health care professionals.</s>
 <s id="32">But we would pay a heavy price.</s>
 <s id="33">Many persons and health professionals had become high-risk contacts.</s>
 <s id="34">This actually meant 21 days counting to potentially disease or death.</s>
 <s id="35">Our health systems were fragile, our health workers lacked skills and training.</s>
 <s id="36">So in the weeks and months that followed, health workers were disproportionately affected by the Ebola virus disease.</s>
 <s id="37">More than 400 nurses, doctors and other health professionals became infected.</s>
 <s id="38">Unfortunately, my friend, the general surgeon who correctly identified the symptoms in that first case became one of the casualties.</s>
 <s id="39">On July 27, the president of Liberia imposed quarantine on the worst-affected areas.</s>
 <s id="40">She closed all the schools and universities and shut down many public events.</s>
 <s id="41">Four days later, the United States Peace Corps pulled out of Liberia, out of Sierra Leone and Guinea due to Ebola.</s>
 <s id="42">In August, six weeks after the nurse died, hundreds of people were dying of the disease each week.</s>
 <s id="43">People were dying in the streets.</s>
 <s id="44">Over the months that followed, West Africa would lose thousands of people to Ebola virus disease.</s>
 <s id="45">In August, I joined a team to set up the Ebola treatment unit at JFK hospital in Monrovia.</s>
 <s id="46">I was charged with running the second Ebola treatment unit in the city.</s>
 <s id="47">Our unit provided hope for thousands of patients, families and communities.</s>
 <s id="48">I not only provided care, I came face to face with Ebola.</s>
 <s id="49">Living every day as a high-risk Ebola virus disease contact during the worst of the outbreak was one of my worst experiences.</s>
 <s id="50">I started counting 21 days every day.</s>
 <s id="51">I lived every moment anticipating the onset of symptoms of the disease.</s>
 <s id="52">I measured my body temperature several times.</s>
 <s id="53">I showered with chlorinated water, more concentrated than actually recommended.</s>
 <s id="54">I chlorinated my phones, my pants, my hands, my car.</s>
 <s id="55">My clothes became bleached.</s>
 <s id="56">Those days you were alone, people were so afraid of touching anybody.</s>
 <s id="57">Everyone was counted as a potential contact.</s>
 <s id="58">Touching would make them sick.</s>
 <s id="59">I was stigmatized.</s>
 <s id="60">But if that was what it was for me, who was symptom-free, imagine what it was for someone who actually had symptoms, someone who had Ebola.</s>
 <s id="61">We learned that to treat Ebola successfully, we had to suspend some of the normal rules of society.</s>
 <s id="62">Our president declared a state of emergency in August and suspended certain rights.</s>
 <s id="63">And the national police even supported our work during the Ebola response.</s>
 <s id="64">In February 2015, gang members came in for isolation in our Ebola isolation unit.</s>
 <s id="65">They were also know as the VIP Boys of Monrovia, terrifying small-time drug addicts whose presence could instill a tremendous amount of fear, although they could not legally carry guns.</s>
 <s id="66">They underwent quarantine for 21 days in our unit and were not arrested.</s>
 <s id="67">We told the police, "If you arrest them here, they will stop coming, they won't get treated.</s>
 <s id="68">And the Ebola virus will continue to spread."</s>
 <s id="69">The police agreed, and we were able to treat the VIP Boys, and they did not have to worry about being arrested while in the unit.</s>
 <s id="70">Over the course of the outbreak, West Africa had almost 29,000 cases.</s>
 <s id="71">More than 11,000 people died.</s>
 <s id="72">And that included 12 of my fine colleagues at John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia.</s>
 <s id="73">In June 2016, exactly 23 months after my first Ebola patient died, Liberia declared its Ebola outbreak ended.</s>
 <s id="74">We thought that once the outbreak ended, so did the problems.</s>
 <s id="75">We hoped that life would go back to normal.</s>
 <s id="76">Today, there are more than 17,000 survivors in West Africa.</s>
 <s id="77">People who actually had Ebola virus disease, lived through it and survived.</s>
 <s id="78">We counted survival rate as a success: the end of suffering for the patient and fulfilling joy for families.</s>
 <s id="79">Every discharge from the unit was a moment of jubilation.</s>
 <s id="80">At least so we thought.</s>
 <s id="81">The best description of the moment of discharge and a rare glimpse into the moment that defines our life post-Ebola was vividly expressed in the words of my best friend and fellow doctor, Philip Ireland, in an interview with "The Times."</s>
 <s id="82">He said at the time of his release, "There were a lot of people there from JFK hospital: my family, my elder brother, my wife was there.</s>
 <s id="83">A lot of other doctors were there, too, and members of the media were there.</s>
 <s id="84">And I felt like Nelson Mandela, it felt like the 'Long Walk to Freedom,' and I walked and raised my hands to the heaven, thanking God for saving my life."</s>
 <s id="85">And Philip said, "Then I saw something else.</s>
 <s id="86">There were a lot of crying people, people happy to see me.</s>
 <s id="87">But when I got close to anybody, they backed away."</s>
 <s id="88">For many Ebola survivors, society still seems to be backing away, even as they struggle to lead a normal life.</s>
 <s id="89">For these survivors, life can be compared to another health emergency.</s>
 <s id="90">They may suffer debilitating joint and body pain.</s>
 <s id="91">The suffering gradually decays over time for most.</s>
 <s id="92">However, many continue to bear intermittent pain.</s>
 <s id="93">Some survivors are blind, others have neurological disabilities.</s>
 <s id="94">Some survivors experience stigmatization every day, in many ways.</s>
 <s id="95">A lot of children are orphans.</s>
 <s id="96">Some survivors experience post-traumatic stress disorder.</s>
 <s id="97">And some survivors lack opportunity for education.</s>
 <s id="98">Even families can be split apart by fear of Ebola, too.</s>
 <s id="99">There's no definitive cure for transmitting Ebola virus through sex.</s>
 <s id="100">However, there are successful interventions for prevention.</s>
 <s id="101">We have worked hard on semen testing, behavioral counseling, safe sex promotion and research.</s>
 <s id="102">For the past year, there have been no cases of sexual transmission.</s>
 <s id="103">But some male survivors have lost their spouses out of fear they will be infected with Ebola.</s>
 <s id="104">That's how families are torn apart.</s>
 <s id="105">Another tremendous challenge for Ebola survivors is obtaining adequate health care.</s>
 <s id="106">In theory, Liberia's public health services are free of charge.</s>
 <s id="107">In practice, our health system lacks the funding and capacity to expand care to all at the point of need.</s>
 <s id="108">Many survivors have waited many months to undergo surgery to heal their blinding cataracts.</s>
 <s id="109">Few had to relive the traumatic experience, when their blood was retested for Ebola at the point of admission.</s>
 <s id="110">Some survivors experienced delayed or deferred admission due to limited bed capacity.</s>
 <s id="111">No bed available for one more patient.</s>
 <s id="112">This is neither national policy nor officially condoned, but many people are still afraid of the sporadic resurgence of Ebola virus.</s>
 <s id="113">The results can be tragic.</s>
 <s id="114">I have seen Beatrice, an Ebola survivor, several times now.</s>
 <s id="115">She's 26 years old.</s>
 <s id="116">Many of her family members became infected, she luckily survived.</s>
 <s id="117">But since that day in 2014 she was discharged to cheering health workers, her life has never been the same.</s>
 <s id="118">She became blind as the result of Ebola.</s>
 <s id="119">In 2014, the baby of a dear friend of mine was only two months old, when both parents and child were admitted in an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia.</s>
 <s id="120">Luckily, they survived.</s>
 <s id="121">My friend's baby is almost three years old now, but cannot stand, cannot walk, cannot speak.</s>
 <s id="122">He has failure to thrive.</s>
 <s id="123">There are many more hidden experiences and many stories are yet untold.</s>
 <s id="124">The survivors of Ebola deserve our attention and support.</s>
 <s id="125">The only way we can defeat this pandemic is when we ensure that we win this final battle.</s>
 <s id="126">Our best opportunity is to ensure that every survivor receives adequate care at the point of need without any form of stigma and at no cost to them personally.</s>
 <s id="127">How can a society consider itself healed when a person's entire identity is defined by the fact that they recovered from Ebola?</s>
 <s id="128">Should a previous disease that a person no longer has become the sum total of their identity, the identifier in their passport that deters you from traveling to seek medical care abroad?</s>
 <s id="129">Simply the ID that denies you health care.</s>
 <s id="130">Or prevents you from having a relationship with your spouse.</s>
 <s id="131">Or denies you of family, of friend or home.</s>
 <s id="132">Or prevents you from carrying on your normal job, so you can put food on the table or have a roof over your family's head.</s>
 <s id="133">What is the meaning of the right to life when our life is clouded by stigma and barriers that fuel that stigma?</s>
 <s id="134">Until we have much better answers to those questions in West Africa, our work is not over yet.</s>
 <s id="135">Liberians are a resilient people.</s>
 <s id="136">And we know how to rise to a challenge, even a devastating one.</s>
 <s id="137">My best memories of the outbreak center on those many people who survived the disease, but I cannot forget the hard-working nurses, doctors, volunteers and staff who risked their own safety in service of humanity.</s>
 <s id="138">And some even losing their lives in the process.</s>
 <s id="139">During the worst of the contagion, one thing kept us making those perilous daily journeys into the Ebola wards.</s>
 <s id="140">We had a passion to save lives.</s>
 <s id="141">Was I afraid during the Ebola outbreak?</s>
 <s id="142">Of course I was.</s>
 <s id="143">But for me, the opportunity to protect our global health security and keep communities safe at home and abroad was an honor.</s>
 <s id="144">So as the dangers became greater, our humanity became stronger.</s>
 <s id="145">We faced our fears.</s>
 <s id="146">The global health community working together defeated Ebola, and that ...</s>
 <s id="147">that is how I know that we can defeat its aftermath in our hearts, in our minds and in our communities.</s>
 <s id="148">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="149">(Applause)</s>
