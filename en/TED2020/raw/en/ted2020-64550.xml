 <s id="1">It’s just after sunrise, and 16-year-old Mori Banshirô is already hard at work practicing drills with his long sword.</s>
 <s id="2">Banshirô is an ambitious samurai in training, and today he must impress his teachers more than ever.</s>
 <s id="3">Today he’ll make his request to travel to the capital city of Edo for a year of martial and scholarly studies, and he needs their support, along with his father’s.</s>
 <s id="4">The year is 1800 in the castle town of Kôchi, capital of the Tosa domain in Japan.</s>
 <s id="5">The daimyo rules the domain, and about 1,500 samurai retainers serve him.</s>
 <s id="6">For 200 years, Japan has been at peace, and the samurai, once primarily warriors, now play a much wider range of roles— they are also government officials, scholars, teachers, and even masters of the tea ceremony or artists.</s>
 <s id="7">To prepare for these diverse responsibilities, young samurai like Banshirô study the “twin paths” of literary learning and the martial arts.</s>
 <s id="8">At 15, he went through the rites of adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords.</s>
 <s id="9">The long sword is for training and combat, while the short sword has a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, or the daimyo.</s>
 <s id="10">Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman who lived 150 years earlier.</s>
 <s id="11">But Banshirô doesn’t admire his swordsmanship alone.</s>
 <s id="12">Miyamoto Musashi was also a master calligrapher and painter.</s>
 <s id="13">That’s the real reason Banshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too.</s>
 <s id="14">After finishing his practice at home, he bids his father goodbye and walks to school.</s>
 <s id="15">His father is preparing to accompany the daimyo to the capital.</s>
 <s id="16">The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese military government, requires all the regional rulers to alternate years between their castle town in the home domain and the capital city.</s>
 <s id="17">The costly treks back and forth keep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up their own military forces to challenge the shogunate.</s>
 <s id="18">The daimyo’s wife and children live in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages to ensure his loyalty.</s>
 <s id="19">But the practice doesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm of life in Japan.</s>
 <s id="20">Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo.</s>
 <s id="21">This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s turn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, he’ll need permission from both his father and the domain.</s>
 <s id="22">At school, Banshirô’s first lesson is in swordfighting.</s>
 <s id="23">Under his teacher’s stern eye, he pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines he’s been practicing.</s>
 <s id="24">At the end of the lesson, he reminds the instructor of his request to go to Edo.</s>
 <s id="25">The instructor cracks his first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident he will gain his support.</s>
 <s id="26">Next, Banshirô practices archery, horsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses in the afternoon.</s>
 <s id="27">Courses cover Confucian philosophy, morality, and history.</s>
 <s id="28">When the instructor calls on him, he has the response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter for his campaign.</s>
 <s id="29">By the end of the day, Banshirô feels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest challenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father.</s>
 <s id="30">His father believes the martial arts are more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention his artistic ambitions.</s>
 <s id="31">Instead, he talks about renowned sword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn to improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi.</s>
 <s id="32">Then, he makes his final, strongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, his father can retire and send him instead in the future.</s>
 <s id="33">It’s this last point that finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees to take him on his tour of duty.</s>
 <s id="34">In the bustle of the capital city, Banshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition to become a painter.</s>
