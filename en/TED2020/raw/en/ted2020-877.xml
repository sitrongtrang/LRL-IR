 <s id="1">Hi there.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines and life.</s>
 <s id="3">Or, more specifically, what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video.</s>
 <s id="4">Some of you may recognize this image.</s>
 <s id="5">This is the opening frame of the video that we created.</s>
 <s id="6">We'll be showing the video at the end, but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.</s>
 <s id="8">And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.</s>
 <s id="9">They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."</s>
 <s id="10">50-million-plus views on YouTube.</s>
 <s id="11">Four guys dancing on treadmills, no cuts, just a static camera.</s>
 <s id="12">A fantastically viral and wonderful video.</s>
 <s id="13">So we were really excited about working with them.</s>
 <s id="14">And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.</s>
 <s id="15">And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.</s>
 <s id="16">Now, for those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.</s>
 <s id="17">So we were excited by this idea, and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.</s>
 <s id="18">And we came up with some parameters, because, you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open.</s>
 <s id="19">And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video.</s>
 <s id="20">So we came up with a list of requirements, the "10 commandments," and they were, in order of ascending difficulty: The first is "No magic."</s>
 <s id="21">Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer.</s>
 <s id="22">The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.</s>
 <s id="23">They wanted band integration, that is, the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around.</s>
 <s id="24">They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.</s>
 <s id="25">So as the song picks up emotion, so should the machine get grander in its process.</s>
 <s id="26">They wanted us to make use of the space.</s>
 <s id="27">So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using, divided between two floors.</s>
 <s id="28">It included an exterior loading dock.</s>
 <s id="29">We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.</s>
 <s id="30">They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.</s>
 <s id="31">The machine itself would start the music.</s>
 <s id="32">So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.</s>
 <s id="33">And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.</s>
 <s id="34">And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.</s>
 <p id="p35">
  <s id="35.1">Okay.</s>
  <s id="35.2">(Laughter) They wanted it to end precisely on time.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="36">Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.</s>
 <s id="37">And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song.</s>
 <s id="38">And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right, they wanted it in one shot.</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) (Applause) Okay.</s>
 <s id="40">So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process.</s>
 <s id="41">The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.</s>
 <s id="42">It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction.</s>
 <s id="43">Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.</s>
 <s id="44">We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process.</s>
 <s id="45">We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.</s>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.</s>
 <s id="47">And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.</s>
 <s id="48">And it's actually in the machine.</s>
 <s id="49">So what did we learn from all of this?</s>
 <s id="50">Well, having completed this, we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.</s>
 <s id="51">And we learned that small stuff stinks.</s>
 <s id="52">Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.</s>
 <s id="53">And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.</s>
 <s id="54">It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go.</s>
 <s id="55">But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start, so that we would have somewhere to go.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">And so you have to start with it.</s>
  <s id="56.2">You have to focus on it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">Small stuff stinks, but, of course, it's essential, right?</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">What else?</s>
  <s id="58.2">Planning is incredibly important.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.</s>
 <s id="60">It's been said that, "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy."</s>
 <s id="61">I think our enemy was physics -- (Laughter) and she's a cruel mistress.</s>
 <s id="62">Often, we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.</s>
 <s id="63">And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.</s>
 <s id="64">These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.</s>
 <s id="65">So also, put reliable stuff last, the stuff that's going to run every time.</s>
 <s id="66">Again, small to large is relevant here.</s>
 <s id="67">The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big, real car near the end of the video.</s>
 <s id="68">The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.</s>
 <s id="69">The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem.</s>
 <s id="70">But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.</s>
 <s id="71">So you put that up front so that, if it fails, at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing.</s>
 <s id="72">Life can be messy.</s>
 <s id="73">There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.</s>
 <s id="74">Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.</s>
 <s id="75">And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.</s>
 <s id="76">So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad, "This Too Shall Pass."</s>
 <s id="77">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="78">(Applause) And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go.</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">OK Go: An introduction.</s>
  <s id="79.2">Hello TEDxUSC.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">We are OK Go.</s>
 <p id="p81">
  <s id="81.1">What are we doing?</s>
  <s id="81.2">Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy.</s>
  <s id="81.3">What what!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p82">
  <s id="82.1">It think we can do better than this.</s>
  <s id="82.2">Hello TEDxUSC.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">We are OK Go.</s>
  <s id="83.2">Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="84">I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.</s>
 <s id="85">Let me start again.</s>
 <s id="86">We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."</s>
 <s id="87">Tim's sundial hat.</s>
 <s id="88">Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?</s>
 <s id="89">Sorry, start again.</s>
 <s id="90">(Barking) Dogs.</s>
 <p id="p91">
  <s id="91.1">Hello, TEDxUSC.</s>
  <s id="91.2">We are OK Go, and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="92">[unclear] Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.</s>
 <p id="p93">
  <s id="93.1">That one's pretty good.</s>
  <s id="93.2">It's getting better.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="94">(Music) ♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫ ♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫ ♫ If there ain't all that much to lug around ♫ ♫ Better run like hell when you hit the ground ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ You can't stop these kids from dancing ♫ ♫ Why would you want to? ♫ ♫ Especially when you're already getting yours ♫ ♫ Cuz if your mind don't move and your knees don't bend ♫ ♫ Well don't go blaming the kids again ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ Let it go ♫ ♫ This too shall pass ♫ ♫ Let it go ♫ ♫ This too shall pass ♫ ♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫ ♫ No, you can't keep letting it get you down ♫ ♫ Let it go ♫ ♫ This too shall pass ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ ♫ When the morning comes ♫ (Cheering)</s>
