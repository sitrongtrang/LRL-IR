 <s id="1">A long time ago, I was a professional animator.</s>
 <s id="2">(Music) [Eric Dyer] [Animator] [Compositor] And at night, I would make my own experimental films.</s>
 <s id="3">(Music) And I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen, and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again.</s>
 <s id="4">Now, before "The Simpsons," before "Gumby," before "Betty Boop," before there was such a thing as cinema and television, animation was hugely popular in this form.</s>
 <s id="5">This is a zoetrope.</s>
 <s id="6">And you spin this drum, and you look through the slits into the inside of the drum, and you see the animation pop to life.</s>
 <s id="7">This is animation in physical form, and it's animation I could get my hands on again.</s>
 <s id="8">I took these ideas to Denmark.</s>
 <s id="9">I went there with my family on a Fulbright Fellowship.</s>
 <s id="10">That's my daughter, Mia.</s>
 <s id="11">I rode around the city on my bicycle and shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen: the boaters in the canals, the colors that explode in spring, the free-use city bikes, love, textures, the healthy cuisine -- (Laughter) And I brought all that video back into the physical world by printing it out on these long strips of ink-jet paper and cutting out the forms.</s>
 <s id="12">Now, I invented my own form of the zoetrope, which removes the drum and replaces the slits with a video camera.</s>
 <s id="13">And this was very exciting for me, because it meant that I could make these physical objects, and I could make films from those objects.</s>
 <s id="14">That's me riding on my bicycle.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) I made about 25 paper sculptures, each the size of a bicycle wheel.</s>
 <s id="16">I brought them into the studio, spun them and shot them to make the film "Copenhagen Cycles."</s>
 <s id="17">(Music) This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again but it helped me get my life back.</s>
 <s id="18">Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a screen, I was having these little adventures with our new family and shooting video along the way, and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life.</s>
 <s id="19">And I think that it's no mistake that zoetrope translates into "wheel of life."</s>
 <s id="20">(Music) But film and video does flatten sculpture, so I tried to imagine a way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such, and also a completely immersive kind of animated sculpture.</s>
 <s id="21">And that's where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel.</s>
 <s id="22">You walk through with a handheld strobe, and wherever you point the flashlight, the animation pops to life.</s>
 <s id="23">I plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) But I did build a half-scale prototype.</s>
 <s id="25">It's covered in Velcro, and I could lay inside on this bridge and stick animated sequences to the walls and test stuff out.</s>
 <s id="26">People would comment that it reminded them of an MRI.</s>
 <s id="27">And that medical connection spoke to me, because at the age of 14, I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition that's slowly taking my vision away, and I'd never responded to that in my work.</s>
 <s id="28">So I responded to it in this piece called, "Implant."</s>
 <s id="29">It is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve.</s>
 <s id="30">And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it.</s>
 <s id="31">With a handheld strobe, they can explore the sculpture, and discover thousands of cell-sized robots hard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve, being deployed to the retina to repair it.</s>
 <s id="32">It's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder.</s>
 <s id="33">(Machine buzzes) Now, in the real-world gene therapy and gene therapy research, healthy genes are being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses.</s>
 <s id="34">There's a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this, and there's also some creepy, threatening idea of viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body.</s>
 <s id="35">Vision loss has helped to take me away from the things that disconnect me from the world.</s>
 <s id="36">Instead of being sealed off in an automobile, I ride my bike, take buses and trains and walk a lot.</s>
 <s id="37">And instead of a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily, I'm also getting outdoors a lot more and using more of my senses.</s>
 <s id="38">This landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego, California.</s>
 <s id="39">My brother lives out that way.</s>
 <s id="40">He and I went camping there for four days.</s>
 <s id="41">And I grabbed my camera, and I walked through the canyons.</s>
 <s id="42">And I tried to imagine and figure out what kind of motion would be present in this place that was so still and so devoid of motion.</s>
 <s id="43">I think it's the stillest place I've ever been.</s>
 <s id="44">And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the animation.</s>
 <s id="45">It was the motion of changing perspective.</s>
 <s id="46">So I created this piece called "Mud Caves" from those photographs.</s>
 <s id="47">It's a multilayered print piece, and you can think of it as a zoetrope laid flat.</s>
 <s id="48">It's kind of my western landscape panorama.</s>
 <s id="49">And next to the print piece there's a video monitor that shows the animation hidden within the artwork.</s>
 <s id="50">I think one of the best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot, who lives 2,500 miles away from me.</s>
 <s id="51">And we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape sculpted by water over millions of years and talk.</s>
 <s id="52">We'd talk about our kids growing up and the slowing pace of our parents, and our dad who's suffering from leukemia, memory loss and infection.</s>
 <s id="53">And it struck me that, as individuals, we're finite, but as a family, we are an ongoing cycle -- a kind of wheel of life.</s>
 <s id="54">Now, I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my mentors.</s>
 <s id="55">She reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury, but a necessity.</s>
 <s id="56">She's Pixie, and she's our family dog.</s>
 <s id="57">And she loves to jump.</s>
 <s id="58">(Dog barking) (Dog barking and spring boinging) And this is a new kind of zoetrope that I developed at the Imaging Research Center at UMBC in Baltimore.</s>
 <s id="59">And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."</s>
 <s id="60">(Dog barking) (Dog barking and spring boinging) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="61">(Applause)</s>
