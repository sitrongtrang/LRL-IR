 <s id="1">Imagine you and a friend are strolling through an art exhibit and a striking painting catches your eye.</s>
 <s id="2">The vibrant red appears to you as a symbol of love, but your friend is convinced it's a symbol of war.</s>
 <s id="3">And where you see stars in a romantic sky, your friend interprets global warming-inducing pollutants.</s>
 <s id="4">To settle the debate, you turn to the internet, where you read that the painting is a replica of the artist's first-grade art project: Red was her favorite color and the silver dots are fairies.</s>
 <s id="5">You now know the exact intentions that led to the creation of this work.</s>
 <s id="6">Are you wrong to have enjoyed it as something the artist didn’t intend?</s>
 <s id="7">Do you enjoy it less now that you know the truth?</s>
 <s id="8">Just how much should the artist's intention affect your interpretation of the painting?</s>
 <s id="9">It's a question that's been tossed around by philosophers and art critics for decades, with no consensus in sight.</s>
 <s id="10">In the mid-20th century, literary critic W.K. Wimsatt and philosopher Monroe Beardsley argued that artistic intention was irrelevant.</s>
 <s id="11">They called this the Intentional Fallacy: the belief that valuing an artist's intentions was misguided.</s>
 <s id="12">Their argument was twofold: First, the artists we study are no longer living, never recorded their intentions, or are simply unavailable to answer questions about their work.</s>
 <s id="13">Second, even if there were a bounty of relevant information, Wimsatt and Beardsley believed it would distract us from the qualities of the work itself.</s>
 <s id="14">They compared art to a dessert: When you taste a pudding, the chef's intentions don't affect whether you enjoy its flavor or texture.</s>
 <s id="15">All that matters, they said, is that the pudding "works."</s>
 <s id="16">Of course, what "works" for one person might not "work" for another.</s>
 <s id="17">And since different interpretations appeal to different people, the silver dots in our painting could be reasonably interpreted as fairies, stars, or pollutants.</s>
 <s id="18">By Wimsatt and Beardsley's logic, the artist's interpretation of her own work would just be one among many equally acceptable possibilities.</s>
 <s id="19">If you find this problematic, you might be more in line with Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels, two literary theorists who rejected the Intentional Fallacy.</s>
 <s id="20">They argued that an artist's intended meaning was not just one possible interpretation, but the only possible interpretation.</s>
 <s id="21">For example, suppose you're walking along a beach and come across a series of marks in the sand that spell out a verse of poetry.</s>
 <s id="22">Knapp and Michaels believed the poem would lose all meaning if you discovered these marks were not the work of a human being, but an odd coincidence produced by the waves.</s>
 <s id="23">They believed an intentional creator is what makes the poem subject to understanding at all.</s>
 <s id="24">Other thinkers advocate for a middle ground, suggesting that intention is just one piece in a larger puzzle.</s>
 <s id="25">Contemporary philosopher Noel Carroll took this stance, arguing that an artist's intentions are relevant to their audience the same way a speaker's intentions are relevant to the person they’re engaging in conversation.</s>
 <s id="26">To understand how intentions function in conversation, Carroll said to imagine someone holding a cigarette and asking for a match.</s>
 <s id="27">You respond by handing them a lighter, gathering that their motivation is to light their cigarette.</s>
 <s id="28">The words they used to ask the question are important, but the intentions behind the question dictate your understanding and ultimately, your response.</s>
 <s id="29">So which end of this spectrum do you lean towards?</s>
 <s id="30">Do you, like Wimsatt and Beardsley, believe that when it comes to art, the proof should be in the pudding?</s>
 <s id="31">Or do you think that an artist's plans and motivations for their work affect its meaning?</s>
 <s id="32">Artistic interpretation is a complex web that will probably never offer a definitive answer.</s>
