 <s id="1">There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power, that spells exist, and that if we could only pronounce the right words, then -- whoosh! -- you know, an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits, right?</s>
 <s id="2">So this is a very attractive idea, because we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice, or the world's greatest computer programmer.</s>
 <s id="3">This idea has a lot of traction with us.</s>
 <s id="4">We love the idea that words, when pronounced, are little more than pure information, but they evoke physical action in the real world that helps us do work.</s>
 <s id="5">So, of course, with lots of programmable computers and robots around, this is an easy thing to picture.</s>
 <s id="6">How many of you know what I'm talking about?</s>
 <s id="7">Raise your right hand.</s>
 <s id="8">How many don't know what I'm talking about?</s>
 <s id="9">Raise your left hand.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">So that's great.</s>
  <s id="10.2">So that was too easy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">You guys have very insecure computers, OK?</s>
 <s id="12">So now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell.</s>
 <s id="13">This is a computer program made of zeros and ones.</s>
 <s id="14">It can be pronounced on a computer, does something like this.</s>
 <s id="15">The important thing is we can write it in a high-level language.</s>
 <s id="16">A computer magician can write this thing.</s>
 <s id="17">It can be compiled into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer.</s>
 <s id="18">And that's what makes computers powerful, these high-level languages that can be compiled.</s>
 <s id="19">And so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer to actually have a spell.</s>
 <s id="20">In fact, what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information -- you encode a spell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpret that information and run a program.</s>
 <s id="21">It's what happens in proteins.</s>
 <s id="22">When this amino-acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms, these little letters are sticky for each other.</s>
 <s id="23">It collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA.</s>
 <s id="24">The interesting thing is that if you change the sequence, you change the three-dimensional folding.</s>
 <s id="25">You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.</s>
 <s id="26">These are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write.</s>
 <s id="27">The problem is, we don't know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.</s>
 <s id="28">So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA.</s>
 <s id="29">We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something we understand really well -- so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.</s>
 <s id="30">So then, we think we can do that.</s>
 <s id="31">One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?</s>
 <s id="32">I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.</s>
 <s id="33">So here's a shape.</s>
 <s id="34">I actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear, coding, like Linus [Torvalds], in that picture before.</s>
 <s id="35">This program takes a shape and spits out 250 DNA sequences.</s>
 <s id="36">These short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand into this shape that we want to make.</s>
 <s id="37">So you send an e-mail with these sequences in it to a company, and the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer, a machine about the size of a photocopier.</s>
 <s id="38">And they take your e-mail, and every letter in your e-mail, they replace with a 30-atom cluster -- one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.</s>
 <s id="39">They string them up in the right sequence, and then they send them back to you via FedEx.</s>
 <s id="40">So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.</s>
 <s id="41">I mix them together, add a little bit of salt water, and then add this long strand I was telling you about, that I've stolen from a virus.</s>
 <s id="42">And then what happens is, you heat this whole thing up to about boiling.</s>
 <s id="43">You cool it down to room temperature, and as you do, those short strands do the following thing: each one of them binds that long strand in one place, and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place, and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so they stick together.</s>
 <s id="44">So the net effect of all 250 of these strands is to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for.</s>
 <s id="45">It'll approximate that shape.</s>
 <s id="46">We do this for real, in the test tube.</s>
 <s id="47">In each little drop of water, you get 50 billion of these guys.</s>
 <s id="48">With a microscope, you can see them on a surface.</s>
 <s id="49">The neat thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell, just change the sequence of the staples, you can make a molecule that looks like this.</s>
 <s id="50">And, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies.</s>
 <s id="51">A lot of them are actually pretty good.</s>
 <s id="52">If you change the spell again, you change the sequence again, you get really nice, 130-nanometer triangles.</s>
 <s id="53">If you do it again, you can get arbitrary patterns.</s>
 <s id="54">So on a rectangle, you can paint patterns of North and South America, or the words, "DNA."</s>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">So that's DNA origami.</s>
  <s id="55.2">That's one way.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="56">There are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA.</s>
 <s id="57">What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self-assembly so we can build anything, right?</s>
 <s id="58">We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world.</s>
 <s id="59">We want to learn how to build biological artifacts, like people and whales and trees.</s>
 <s id="60">And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity, if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good, then that will truly be magic.</s>
 <s id="61">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="62">(Applause)</s>
