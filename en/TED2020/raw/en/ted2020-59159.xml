 <s id="1">My name is Rebecca, and I'm a cyborg.</s>
 <s id="2">(Laughter) Specifically, I have 32 computer chips inside my head, which rebuild my sense of hearing.</s>
 <s id="3">This is called a cochlear implant.</s>
 <s id="4">You remember the Borg from Star Trek, those aliens who conquered and absorbed everything in sight?</s>
 <s id="5">Well, that's me.</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) The good news is I come for your technology and not for your human life-forms.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) Actually, I've never seen an episode of Star Trek.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) But there's a reason for that: television wasn't closed-captioned when I was a kid.</s>
 <s id="9">I grew up profoundly deaf.</s>
 <s id="10">I went to regular schools, and I had to lip-read.</s>
 <s id="11">I didn't meet another deaf person until I was 20.</s>
 <s id="12">Electronics were mostly audio back then.</s>
 <s id="13">My alarm clock was my sister Barbara, who would set her alarm and then throw something at me to wake up.</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) My hearing aids were industrial-strength, sledgehammer volume, but they helped me more than they helped most people.</s>
 <s id="15">With them, I could hear music and the sound of my own voice.</s>
 <s id="16">I've always liked the idea that technology can help make the world more human.</s>
 <s id="17">I used to watch the stereo flash color when the music shifted, and I knew it was just a matter of time before my watch could show me sound, too.</s>
 <s id="18">Did you know that hearing occurs in the brain?</s>
 <s id="19">In your ear is a small organ called the cochlea, and the cochlea is lined with thousands of receptors called hair cells.</s>
 <s id="20">When sound enters your ear, those hair cells, they send electric signals to your brain, and your brain then interprets that as sound.</s>
 <s id="21">Hair-cell damage is really common: noise exposure, ordinary aging, illness.</s>
 <s id="22">My hair cells were damaged before I was even born.</s>
 <s id="23">My mother was exposed to German measles when she was pregnant with me.</s>
 <s id="24">About five percent of the world has significant hearing loss.</s>
 <s id="25">By 2050, that's expected to double to over 900 million people, or one in 10.</s>
 <s id="26">For seniors, it's already one out of three.</s>
 <s id="27">With a cochlear implant, computer chips do the job for the damaged hair cells.</s>
 <s id="28">Imagine a box of 16 crayons, and those 16 crayons, in combination, have to make all of the colors in the universe.</s>
 <s id="29">Same with the cochlear implant.</s>
 <s id="30">I have 16 electrodes in each of my cochleas.</s>
 <s id="31">Those 16 electrodes, in combination, send signals to my brain, representing all of the sounds in the universe.</s>
 <s id="32">I have electronics inside and outside of my head to make that happen, including a small processor, magnets inside my skull and a rechargeable power source.</s>
 <s id="33">Radio waves transmit sound through the magnets.</s>
 <s id="34">The number one question that I get about the cochlear implant when people hear about the magnets is whether my head sticks to the refrigerator.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) No, it does not.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you, thank you.</s>
 <s id="37">(Applause) I know this, because I tried.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) Hearing people assume that the Deaf live in a perpetual state of wanting to hear, because they can't imagine any other way.</s>
 <s id="39">But I've never once wished to be hearing.</s>
 <s id="40">I just wanted to be part of a community like me.</s>
 <s id="41">I wanted everyone else to be deaf.</s>
 <s id="42">I think that sense of belonging is what ultimately connects our stories, and mine felt incomplete.</s>
 <s id="43">When cochlear implants first got going, back in the '80s, the operation was Frankenstein-monster scary.</s>
 <s id="44">By 2001, the procedure had evolved considerably, but it still wiped out any natural hearing that you had.</s>
 <s id="45">The success rate then for speech comprehension was low, maybe 50 percent.</s>
 <s id="46">So if it didn't work, you couldn't go back.</s>
 <s id="47">At that time, implants were also controversial in the Deaf culture.</s>
 <s id="48">Basically, it was considered the equivalent of changing the color of your skin.</s>
 <s id="49">I held off for a while, but my hearing was going downhill fast, and hearing aids were no longer helping.</s>
 <s id="50">So in 2003, I made the tough decision to have the cochlear implant.</s>
 <s id="51">I just needed to stop that soul-sucking cycle of loss, regardless of whether the operation worked, and I really didn't think that it would.</s>
 <s id="52">I saw it as one last box to check off before I made the transition to being completely deaf, which a part of me wanted.</s>
 <s id="53">Complete silence is very addictive.</s>
 <s id="54">Maybe you've spent time in a sensory deprivation tank, and you know what I mean.</s>
 <s id="55">Silence has mind-expanding capabilities.</s>
 <s id="56">In silence, I see sound.</s>
 <s id="57">When I watch a music video without sound, I can hear music.</s>
 <s id="58">In the absence of sound, my brain fills in the gaps based on the movement I see.</s>
 <s id="59">My mind is no longer competing with the distraction of sound.</s>
 <s id="60">It's freed up to think more creatively.</s>
 <s id="61">There are advantages to having bionic body parts as well.</s>
 <s id="62">It's undeniably convenient to be able to hear, and I can turn it off any time I want.</s>
 <s id="63">(Laughter) I'm hearing when I need to be, and the rest of the time, I'm not.</s>
 <s id="64">Bionic hearing doesn't age, although external parts sometimes need replacement.</s>
 <s id="65">It would be so cool to just automatically regenerate a damaged part like a real cyborg, but I get mine FedExed from Advanced Bionics.</s>
 <s id="66">(Laughter) Oh, I get updates downloaded into my head.</s>
 <s id="67">(Laughter) It's not quite AirDrop -- but close.</s>
 <s id="68">(Laughter) With the cochlear implant, I can stream music from my iPod into my head without earbuds.</s>
 <s id="69">Recently, I went to a friend's long, tedious concert ...</s>
 <s id="70">(Laughter) and unknown to anyone else, I listened to the Beatles for three hours instead.</s>
 <s id="71">(Laughter) (Applause) Technology has come so far so fast.</s>
 <s id="72">The biggest obstacle I face as a deaf person is no longer a physical barrier.</s>
 <s id="73">It's the way that people respond to my deafness, the outdated way people respond to my deafness -- pity, patronization, even anger -- because that just cancels out the human connection that technology achieves.</s>
 <s id="74">I once had a travel roommate who had a complete temper tantrum, because I didn't hear her knocking on the door when her key didn't work.</s>
 <s id="75">If I hadn't been there, no problem, she could get another key, but when she saw that I was there, her anger boiled over.</s>
 <s id="76">It was no longer about a key.</s>
 <s id="77">It was about deafness not being a good enough reason for her inconvenience.</s>
 <s id="78">Or the commercial about the deaf man whose neighborhood surprised him with sign language messages from people on the street.</s>
 <s id="79">Everyone who sent me the video told me they cried, so I asked them, "Well, what if he wasn't deaf?</s>
 <s id="80">What if his first language was Spanish, and everyone learned Spanish instead?</s>
 <s id="81">Would you have cried?"</s>
 <s id="82">And they all said no.</s>
 <s id="83">They weren't crying because of the communication barrier, they were crying because the man was deaf.</s>
 <s id="84">But I see it differently.</s>
 <s id="85">What if the Borg showed up in that video, and the Borg said, "Deafness is irrelevant."</s>
 <s id="86">Because that's what they say, right?</s>
 <s id="87">Everything's "irrelevant."</s>
 <s id="88">And then the Borg assimilated the deaf guy -- not out of pity, not out of anger, but because he had a biological distinctiveness that the Borg wanted, including unique language capabilities.</s>
 <s id="89">I would much rather see that commercial.</s>
 <s id="90">(Laughter) Why does thinking about ability make people so uncomfortable?</s>
 <s id="91">You might know a play, later a movie, called "Children of a Lesser God," by Mark Medoff.</s>
 <s id="92">That play, that title, actually comes from a poem by Alfred Tennyson, and I interpret both the play and title to say that humans who are perceived as defective were made by a lesser God and live an inferior existence, while those made by the real God are a superior class, because God doesn't make mistakes.</s>
 <s id="93">In World War II, an estimated 275,000 people with disabilities were murdered in special death camps, because they didn't fit Hitler's vision of a superior race.</s>
 <s id="94">Hitler said that he was inspired by the United States, which had enacted involuntary sterilization laws for "the unfit" in the early 1900s.</s>
 <s id="95">That practice continued in more than 30 states until the '70s, with the last law finally repealed in 2003.</s>
 <s id="96">So the world is not that far removed from Tennyson's poem.</s>
 <s id="97">That tendency to make assumptions about people based on ability comes out in sentences like "You're so special," "I couldn't live like that" or "Thank God that's not me."</s>
 <s id="98">Changing how people think is like getting them to break a habit.</s>
 <s id="99">Before the implant, I had stopped using the voice telephone and switched to email, but people kept leaving me voice mail.</s>
 <s id="100">They were upset that I was unreachable by phone and not returning messages.</s>
 <s id="101">I continued to tell them my situation.</s>
 <s id="102">It took them months to adapt.</s>
 <s id="103">Fast-forward 10 years, and you know who else hated voice mail?</s>
 <s id="104">Millennials.</s>
 <s id="105">(Laughter) And you know what they did?</s>
 <s id="106">They normalized texting for communication instead.</s>
 <s id="107">Now, when it comes to ignoring voice mail, it no longer matters whether you're deaf or just self-absorbed.</s>
 <s id="108">(Laughter) (Applause) Millennials changed how people think about messaging.</s>
 <s id="109">They reset the default.</s>
 <s id="110">Can I just tell you how much I love texting?</s>
 <s id="111">Oh, and group texts.</s>
 <s id="112">I have six siblings -- they're all hearing, but I don't think any less of them.</s>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) And we all text.</s>
 <s id="114">Do you know how thrilling it is to have a visual means of communication that everyone else actually uses?</s>
 <s id="115">So I am on a mission now.</s>
 <s id="116">As a consumer of technology, I want visual options whenever there's audio.</s>
 <s id="117">It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf or don't want to wake the baby.</s>
 <s id="118">Both are equally valid.</s>
 <s id="119">Smart designers include multiple ways to access technology, but segregating that access under "accessibility" -- that's just hiding it from mainstream users.</s>
 <s id="120">In order to change how people think, we need to be more than accessible, we need to be connected.</s>
 <s id="121">Apple did this recently.</s>
 <s id="122">On my iPhone, it automatically displays a visual transcript of my voice mail, right next to the audio button.</s>
 <s id="123">I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to.</s>
 <s id="124">You know what else?</s>
 <s id="125">Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime no longer say "Closed-captioned for the hearing impaired."</s>
 <s id="126">They say "subtitles," "on" or "off," with a list of languages underneath, including English.</s>
 <s id="127">Technology has come so far.</s>
 <s id="128">Our mindset just needs to catch up.</s>
 <s id="129">"Resistance is futile."</s>
 <s id="130">(Laughter) You have been assimilated.</s>
 <s id="131">(Laughter) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="132">(Applause)</s>
