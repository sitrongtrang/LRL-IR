 <s id="2">Hi, everybody.</s>
 <s id="3">Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.</s>
 <s id="4">I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life.</s>
 <s id="5">I might look successful and happy being in front of you today, but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair.</s>
 <s id="6">The violin, which meant everything to me, became a grave burden on me.</s>
 <s id="7">Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me, their words sounded like meaningless noise.</s>
 <s id="8">When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering, I started to rediscover the true power of music.</s>
 <s id="9">(Music) In the midst of hardship, it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.</s>
 <s id="10">The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable, and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too, and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist.</s>
 <s id="11">Do you feel like you are all alone?</s>
 <s id="12">I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart, as it did for me.</s>
 <s id="13">(Music) (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="14">Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries.</s>
 <s id="15">My audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music.</s>
 <s id="16">I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few.</s>
 <s id="17">Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you.</s>
 <s id="18">Let me introduce you to my brand new project, "Baroque in Rock," which became a golden disc most recently.</s>
 <s id="19">It's such an honor for me.</s>
 <s id="20">I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.</s>
 <s id="21">But it's now your turn.</s>
 <s id="22">Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.</s>
 <s id="23">Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world.</s>
 <s id="24">I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you, TEDsters.</s>
 <s id="25">Play your life, and stay tuned.</s>
