 <s id="1">In the city of Alexandria in 415 CE, the bishop and the governor were in a fight.</s>
 <s id="2">It started with a disagreement over the behavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation of witchcraft leveled against one of the most powerful figures in the city.</s>
 <s id="3">Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent mathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders.</s>
 <s id="4">In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been the subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost mythical status.</s>
 <s id="5">But while none of Hypatia’s own writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ accounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that made her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately led to her downfall.</s>
 <s id="6">Hypatia was born around 355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province of the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center.</s>
 <s id="7">Her father Theon was an accomplished Greek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown.</s>
 <s id="8">Hypatia was likely an only child, and Theon educated her himself.</s>
 <s id="9">By adulthood, she had surpassed her father in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar and taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, similar to a modern university.</s>
 <s id="10">She refined scientific instruments, wrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient method of long division.</s>
 <s id="11">But perhaps her most significant contributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching.</s>
 <s id="12">The philosophy Hypatia taught drew from the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher Plotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras.</s>
 <s id="13">The convergence of these influences merged to form a school called Neoplatonism.</s>
 <s id="14">For the Neoplatonists, mathematics had a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music.</s>
 <s id="15">These subjects were not studied merely for the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they authenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred language of the universe.</s>
 <s id="16">In the repeated patterns of algebraic formulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the harmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational cosmic force at work.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Students delved into this ordered mathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, known as “the One.”</s>
  <s id="17.2">While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman belief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular deity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside multiple religious viewpoints.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">Jewish and Christian as well as pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of the empire to study with her.</s>
 <s id="19">The nonpartisan environment Hypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the religious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of Alexandria at the time.</s>
 <s id="20">Christianity had recently become the Empire’s state religion.</s>
 <s id="21">The local archbishop Cyril had steadily gained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian monks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population.</s>
 <s id="22">In doing so, he encroached on the secular authority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to a bitter public feud between the two men.</s>
 <s id="23">Because she was seen as a wise and impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with fairness and restraint.</s>
 <s id="24">But when a group of Cyril’s monks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, he had their leader tortured to death.</s>
 <s id="25">Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to turn Orestes against Christianity.</s>
 <s id="26">In March 415, as Hypatia was traveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks dragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her.</s>
 <s id="27">Hypatia’s death was a turning point in the politics of Alexandria.</s>
 <s id="28">In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek and Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of learning declined.</s>
 <s id="29">In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, and fairness she fostered died with her.</s>
