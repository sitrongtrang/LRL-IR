 <s id="1">What's in the box?</s>
 <s id="2">Whatever it is must be pretty important, because I've traveled with it, moved it, from apartment to apartment to apartment.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) (Applause) Sound familiar?</s>
 <s id="4">Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago?</s>
 <s id="5">Three times.</s>
 <s id="6">So you'd think, with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff.</s>
 <s id="7">Nope.</s>
 <s id="8">There's a new industry in town, a 22 billion-dollar, 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry: that of personal storage.</s>
 <s id="9">So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space.</s>
 <s id="10">So where does this lead?</s>
 <s id="11">Lots of credit card debt, huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years.</s>
 <s id="12">Well I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more.</s>
 <s id="13">I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less: college -- in your dorm, traveling -- in a hotel room, camping -- rig up basically nothing, maybe a boat.</s>
 <s id="14">Whatever it was for you, I bet that, among other things, this gave you a little more freedom, a little more time.</s>
 <s id="15">So I'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint.</s>
 <s id="16">It's actually a great way to save you some money.</s>
 <s id="17">And it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.</s>
 <s id="18">So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area.</s>
 <s id="19">First up: crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.</s>
 <s id="20">I wanted it all -- home office, sit down dinner for 10, room for guests, and all my kite surfing gear.</s>
 <s id="21">With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.</s>
 <s id="22">By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.</s>
 <s id="23">instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand.</s>
 <s id="24">Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint.</s>
 <s id="25">And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there.</s>
 <s id="26">So how can you live little?</s>
 <s id="27">Three main approaches.</s>
 <s id="28">First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.</s>
 <s id="29">We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.</s>
 <s id="30">And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?</s>
 <s id="31">It's time for me to let it go.</s>
 <s id="32">We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.</s>
 <s id="33">We need to think before we buy.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">Ask ourselves, "Is that really going to make me happier?</s>
  <s id="34.2">Truly?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff.</s>
 <s id="36">But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff.</s>
 <s id="37">Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy.</s>
 <s id="38">We want space efficiency.</s>
 <s id="39">We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event.</s>
 <s id="40">Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three?</s>
 <s id="41">So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want it digitized.</s>
 <s id="42">You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear -- it's magic.</s>
 <s id="43">Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed -- same space, a little side table stretches out to seat 10.</s>
 <s id="44">In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.</s>
 <s id="45">Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10.</s>
 <s id="46">My office folds away, easily hidden.</s>
 <s id="47">My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers.</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">Guests?</s>
  <s id="48.2">Move the moving wall, have some fold-down guest beds.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">And of course, my own movie theater.</s>
 <s id="50">So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft.</s>
 <s id="51">But consider the benefits of an edited life.</s>
 <s id="52">Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000.</s>
 <s id="53">Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags, maybe a small space, a hotel room.</s>
 <s id="54">So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, "Could I do with a little life editing?</s>
 <s id="55">Would that give me a little more freedom?</s>
 <s id="56">Maybe a little more time?"</s>
 <s id="57">What's in the box?</s>
 <s id="58">It doesn't really matter.</s>
 <s id="59">I know I don't need it.</s>
 <s id="60">What's in yours?</s>
 <s id="61">Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.</s>
 <s id="62">So let's make room for the good stuff.</s>
 <s id="63">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="64">(Applause)</s>
