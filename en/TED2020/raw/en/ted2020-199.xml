 <s id="1">Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.</s>
 <s id="2">My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."</s>
 <s id="3">What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics."</s>
 <s id="4">But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.</s>
 <s id="5">By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?</s>
 <s id="6">Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Raise your hand.</s>
  <s id="7.2">Did your hand go up?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">Now bring it out, bring it out.</s>
  <s id="8.2">Anybody else?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">I see, I see one way in the back.</s>
 <s id="10">You sir, that's three.</s>
 <s id="11">And anybody on this side here?</s>
 <s id="12">OK, over there on the aisle.</s>
 <s id="13">Would the four of you please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage.</s>
 <s id="14">Let's give them a nice round of applause.</s>
 <s id="15">(Applause) That's right.</s>
 <s id="16">Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators, I need to make sure that they are all working properly.</s>
 <s id="17">Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?</s>
 <s id="18">How about a two-digit number?</s>
 <s id="19">Audience: 22.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">AB: 22.</s>
  <s id="20.2">And another two-digit number, sir?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">Audience: 47.</s>
 <s id="22">AB: Multiply 22 times 47, make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working.</s>
 <s id="23">Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?</s>
 <s id="24">Volunteer: No.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">AB: 594.</s>
  <s id="25.2">Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">(Applause) Would you like to try a more standard calculator, just in case?</s>
 <s id="27">OK, great.</s>
 <s id="28">What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.</s>
 <s id="29">That's OK.</s>
 <s id="30">I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.</s>
 <s id="31">There is something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.</s>
 <s id="32">For instance, five squared would be?</s>
 <s id="33">Audience: 25.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">AB: 25.</s>
  <s id="34.2">The way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators that will give you the square.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster.</s>
 <s id="36">What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second, the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer.</s>
  <s id="37.2">OK?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">So quickly, a two-digit number please.</s>
 <s id="39">Audience: 37.</s>
 <s id="40">Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.</s>
 <s id="41">Audience: 23.</s>
 <s id="42">AB: 23 squared, OK.</s>
 <s id="43">Audience: 59.</s>
 <s id="44">AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?</s>
 <s id="45">Audience: 93.</s>
 <s id="46">AB: 93 squared.</s>
 <s id="47">Would you call out your answers, please?</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">Volunteer: 1369.</s>
  <s id="48.2">AB: 1369.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Volunteer: 529.</s>
  <s id="49.2">AB: 529.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">Volunteer: 3481.</s>
  <s id="50.2">AB: 3481.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">Volunteer: 8649.</s>
 <s id="52">AB: Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="53">(Applause) Let me try to take this one step further.</s>
 <s id="54">I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.</s>
 <s id="55">I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.</s>
 <s id="56">Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.</s>
 <s id="57">Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.</s>
 <s id="58">Just give some indication if it's right.</s>
 <s id="59">A three-digit number, sir, yes?</s>
 <s id="60">Audience: 987.</s>
 <s id="61">AB: 987 squared is 974,169.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">(Laughter) AB: Yes?</s>
  <s id="62.2">Good.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir?</s>
 <s id="64">Audience: 457.</s>
 <s id="65">AB: 457 squared is 205,849.</s>
 <s id="66">205,849?</s>
 <s id="67">AB: Yes?</s>
 <s id="68">OK, another, another three-digit number, sir?</s>
 <s id="69">Audience: 321.</s>
 <s id="70">AB: 321 is 103,041.</s>
 <s id="71">103,041.</s>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">Yes?</s>
  <s id="72.2">One more three-digit number please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">Audience: Oh, 722.</s>
 <s id="74">AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.</s>
 <s id="75">Is that 513,284?</s>
 <s id="76">Volunteer: Yes.</s>
 <p id="p77">
  <s id="77.1">AB: Yes?</s>
  <s id="77.2">Oh, one more, one more three-digit number please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="78">Audience: 162.</s>
 <s id="79">162 squared is 26,244.</s>
 <s id="80">Volunteer: Yes.</s>
 <s id="81">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="82">(Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further.</s>
 <s id="83">(Laughter) I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.</s>
 <s id="84">You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right.</s>
 <s id="85">To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four.</s>
 <s id="86">If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square.</s>
 <s id="87">Nine.</s>
 <s id="88">Seven.</s>
 <s id="89">Five.</s>
 <s id="90">Eight.</s>
 <s id="91">9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.</s>
 <s id="92">95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564?</s>
 <s id="93">Volunteer: Yes!</s>
 <s id="94">AB: Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="95">(Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately, most calculators cannot.</s>
 <s id="96">(Laughter) Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?</s>
 <s id="97">So, since we've reached the limits of our calculators -- what's that?</s>
 <s id="98">Does yours go higher?</s>
 <s id="99">Volunteer: I don't know.</s>
 <s id="100">AB: Oh, yours does?</s>
 <p id="p101">
  <s id="101.1">Volunteer: I can probably do it.</s>
  <s id="101.2">AB: I'll talk to you later.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="102">In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.</s>
 <s id="103">Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.</s>
 <s id="104">Would you each enter that on your calculator?</s>
 <s id="105">And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number.</s>
 <s id="106">So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number.</s>
 <s id="107">How many digits do you have, six or seven?</s>
 <s id="108">Seven, and yours?</s>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">Seven?</s>
  <s id="109.2">Seven?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">And, uncertain.</s>
 <s id="111">Seven.</s>
 <s id="112">Is there any possible way that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have?</s>
 <s id="113">Say "No."</s>
 <s id="114">(Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable.</s>
 <s id="115">What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like.</s>
 <s id="116">(Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.</s>
 <s id="117">Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.</s>
 <s id="118">Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.</s>
 <s id="119">AB: Did you leave out the number 6?</s>
 <s id="120">Good, OK, that's one.</s>
 <s id="121">You have a seven-digit number, call out any six of them please.</s>
 <s id="122">Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.</s>
 <p id="p123">
  <s id="123.1">I think I only heard five numbers.</s>
  <s id="123.2">I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="124">Same as she did, OK.</s>
 <s id="125">You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear.</s>
 <s id="126">Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.</s>
 <s id="127">I think you left out the number 3?</s>
 <s id="128">AB: That's three.</s>
 <s id="129">The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000: 10 to the fourth power.</s>
 <s id="130">OK, any six of them.</s>
 <s id="131">(Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please.</s>
 <s id="132">Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.</s>
 <s id="133">Did you leave out the number 7?</s>
 <s id="134">And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.</s>
 <s id="135">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="136">(Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience.</s>
 <s id="137">By any chance, does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on?</s>
 <s id="138">If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand.</s>
 <s id="139">Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first.</s>
 <s id="140">What year was it, first of all?</s>
 <s id="141">That's why I pick a gentleman first.</s>
 <s id="142">Audience: 1953.</s>
 <s id="143">1953, and the month?</s>
 <s id="144">November what?</s>
 <s id="145">23rd -- was that a Monday?</s>
 <s id="146">Audience: Yes.</s>
 <p id="p147">
  <s id="147.1">Good.</s>
  <s id="147.2">Somebody else?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="148">I haven't seen any women's hands up.</s>
 <s id="149">OK, how about you, what year?</s>
 <s id="150">1949, and the month?</s>
 <s id="151">October what?</s>
 <s id="152">Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?</s>
 <p id="p153">
  <s id="153.1">Yes!</s>
  <s id="153.2">I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="154">Yell it out, what year?</s>
 <s id="155">Audience: 1959.</s>
 <s id="156">1959, OK -- and the month?</s>
 <s id="157">Audience: February.</s>
 <s id="158">February what?</s>
 <p id="p159">
  <s id="159.1">Sixth -- was that a Friday?</s>
  <s id="159.2">Audience: Yes.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="160">Good, how about the person behind her?</s>
 <s id="161">Call out, what year was it?</s>
 <p id="p162">
  <s id="162.1">Audience: 1947.</s>
  <s id="162.2">AB: 1947, and the month?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p163">
  <s id="163.1">Audience: May.</s>
  <s id="163.2">AB: May what?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="164">Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?</s>
 <p id="p165">
  <s id="165.1">Audience: Yes.</s>
  <s id="165.2">AB: Thank you very much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="166">(Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born?</s>
 <s id="167">We can do it that way.</s>
 <s id="168">Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that.</s>
 <s id="169">I brought with me a book of calendars.</s>
 <s id="170">It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know.</s>
 <s id="171">(Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir -- you were just sitting there.</s>
 <s id="172">(Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here, if you wouldn't mind.</s>
 <s id="173">This is a book of calendars.</s>
 <s id="174">Who wanted to know their birth day?</s>
 <s id="175">What year was it, first of all?</s>
 <s id="176">Audience: 1966.</s>
 <s id="177">66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966.</s>
 <s id="178">And what month?</s>
 <p id="p179">
  <s id="179.1">Audience: April.</s>
  <s id="179.2">AB: April what?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="180">Audience: 17th.</s>
 <s id="181">I believe that was a Sunday.</s>
 <s id="182">Can you confirm, Chris?</s>
 <s id="183">Chris Anderson: Yes.</s>
 <s id="184">AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater challenge for me.</s>
 <p id="p185">
  <s id="185.1">AB: What year would you like?</s>
  <s id="185.2">CA: 1824.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="186">AB: 1824, OK.</s>
 <s id="187">AB: And what month?</s>
 <s id="188">CA: June.</s>
 <p id="p189">
  <s id="189.1">AB: June what?</s>
  <s id="189.2">CA: Sixth.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="190">AB: Was that a Sunday?</s>
 <p id="p191">
  <s id="191.1">CA: It was.</s>
  <s id="191.2">AB: And it was cloudy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="192">(Laughter) Good, thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="193">(Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.</s>
 <s id="194">There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.</s>
 <s id="195">Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?</s>
 <s id="196">OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are.</s>
 <s id="197">You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?</s>
 <s id="198">OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.</s>
 <s id="199">But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.</s>
 <s id="200">So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.</s>
 <s id="201">Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.</s>
 <s id="202">I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK.</s>
 <s id="203">(Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people, starting with you.</s>
 <s id="204">I'll get five digits: one, two, three, four.</s>
 <s id="205">Oh, I did this row already.</s>
 <s id="206">Let's do the row before you, starting with you: one, two, three, four, five.</s>
 <s id="207">Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square, go ahead.</s>
 <s id="208">Five.</s>
 <s id="209">Seven.</s>
 <s id="210">Six.</s>
 <s id="211">Eight.</s>
 <s id="212">Three.</s>
 <s id="213">57,683 -- squared.</s>
 <s id="214">Yuck.</s>
 <s id="215">Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.</s>
 <s id="216">I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.</s>
 <s id="217">I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two.</s>
 <s id="218">Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer.</s>
 <s id="219">Now, let me recap.</s>
 <s id="220">(Laughter) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="221">(Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right?</s>
 <s id="222">(Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation.</s>
 <s id="223">Let me explain what that is.</s>
 <s id="224">This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert numbers into words.</s>
 <s id="225">I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers.</s>
 <s id="226">I know it sounds complicated; it's not.</s>
 <s id="227">I don't want you to think you're seeing something out of "Rain Man."</s>
 <s id="228">(Laughter) There's definitely a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely.</s>
 <s id="229">Sorry.</s>
 <s id="230">(Laughter) If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then.</s>
 <s id="231">By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.</s>
 <s id="232">If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, "you're close," or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself.</s>
 <s id="233">If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?</s>
 <s id="234">(Laughter) Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK.</s>
 <s id="235">So, without any more stalling, here we go.</s>
 <s id="236">I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683.</s>
 <s id="237">57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.</s>
 <s id="238">38,931; double that to get 77,862.</s>
 <s id="239">77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822.</s>
 <p id="p240">
  <s id="240.1">That seems right, I'll go on.</s>
  <s id="240.2">Cookie fission, OK.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="241">Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion.</s>
 <s id="242">Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489.</s>
 <p id="p243">
  <s id="243.1">Audience: Yeah!</s>
  <s id="243.2">AB: Good.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="244">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="245">(Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.</s>
 <s id="246">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="247">(Applause)</s>
