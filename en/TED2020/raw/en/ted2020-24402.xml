 <s id="1">Few individuals have influenced the world and many of today's thinkers like Plato.</s>
 <s id="2">One 20th century philosopher even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy as a series of footnotes to Plato.</s>
 <s id="3">He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's greatest minds, including Aristotle.</s>
 <s id="4">But even one of the founders of philosophy wasn't perfect.</s>
 <s id="5">Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't exactly stood the test of time.</s>
 <s id="6">So here are brief rundowns of a few of his best and worst ideas.</s>
 <s id="7">Plato argued that beyond our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms.</s>
 <s id="8">Forms are the ideal versions of the things and concepts we see around us.</s>
 <s id="9">They serve as a sort of instruction manual to our own world.</s>
 <s id="10">Floating around the world of Forms is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love.</s>
 <s id="11">Our own reality is comprised of imperfect copies of ideal Forms.</s>
 <s id="12">Plato argued that philosophers should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate our misleading reality.</s>
 <s id="13">While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's most vexing problems.</s>
 <s id="14">It's been the subject of thousands of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike.</s>
 <s id="15">It raises questions like should we trust our senses to come to the truth or our own reason?</s>
 <s id="16">For Plato, the answer is reason.</s>
 <s id="17">It alone provides us with at least the potential to contemplate the Forms.</s>
 <s id="18">But reason didn't always pan out for Plato himself.</s>
 <s id="19">When he sought to situate humankind amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds.</s>
 <s id="20">"Featherless bipeds" was his official designation.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">Diogenes the Cynic, annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold.</s>
  <s id="21.2">Plato's man."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">But back to a few good ideas.</s>
 <s id="23">Plato is one of the earliest political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one of the founders of political science.</s>
 <s id="24">He reasoned that being a ruler was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered the craft were fit to lead.</s>
 <s id="25">Ruling was the craft of contemplating the Forms.</s>
 <s id="26">In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia where justice is the ultimate goal.</s>
 <s id="27">Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king.</s>
 <s id="28">Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were equally able to rule in this model city.</s>
 <s id="29">Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent with women, elsewhere likening them to children.</s>
 <s id="30">He also believed that a woman's womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body and cause illness.</s>
 <s id="31">This bad idea, also espoused by other contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds of years in European medicine.</s>
 <s id="32">Furthermore, he thought that society should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince everyone to follow this structure.</s>
 <s id="33">The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life.</s>
 <s id="34">Some thinkers have gone on to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration for the dictators that used them.</s>
 <s id="35">Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one of the greatest philosophers in history?</s>
 <s id="36">No!</s>
 <s id="37">Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who came after him a place to start.</s>
 <s id="38">Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas through writing and experience, and have accepted some while rejecting others.</s>
 <s id="39">We are continuing to refine, amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations of the modern world.</s>
