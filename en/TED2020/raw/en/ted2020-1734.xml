 <s id="1">So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor.</s>
 <s id="2">My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.</s>
 <s id="3">Everyone knew who I was, so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected, and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.</s>
 <s id="4">She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office, so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class, for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.</s>
 <s id="5">Man, her office was packed.</s>
 <s id="6">So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school, and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.</s>
 <s id="7">But that doesn't mean that we can't.</s>
 <s id="8">It just takes a little bit more.</s>
 <s id="9">Like, I remember one day I found my dad convulsing, foaming at the mouth, OD-ing on the bathroom floor.</s>
 <s id="10">Really, do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list?</s>
 <s id="11">Not so much.</s>
 <s id="12">But I really needed a support network, a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance, that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do.</s>
 <s id="13">I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day, who were going to say, "You can move beyond that."</s>
 <s id="14">And unfortunately, the local junior high was not going to offer that.</s>
 <s id="15">It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.</s>
 <s id="16">So my mom said, "You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day."</s>
 <s id="17">So for the next two years, that's what I did.</s>
 <s id="18">I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.</s>
 <s id="19">And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture.</s>
 <s id="20">There were some people who were really gang-affiliated, and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school.</s>
 <s id="21">Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.</s>
 <s id="22">You had to survive.</s>
 <s id="23">You just had to do things sometimes.</s>
 <s id="24">So there were a lot of teachers who were like, "She's never going to make it.</s>
 <s id="25">She has an issue with authority.</s>
 <s id="26">She's not going to go anywhere."</s>
 <s id="27">Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.</s>
 <s id="28">But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school.</s>
 <s id="29">I was accepted to Pepperdine University, and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant.</s>
 <s id="30">And then I told them, "I want to be a teacher."</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">And boy, they were like, "What?</s>
  <s id="31.2">Why?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Why would you want to do that?"</s>
 <s id="33">So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended, and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me.</s>
 <s id="34">And so every year, I share my background with my kids, because they need to know that everyone has a story, everyone has a struggle, and everyone needs help along the way.</s>
 <s id="35">And I am going to be their help along the way.</s>
 <s id="36">So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.</s>
 <s id="37">I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before.</s>
 <s id="38">I was like, "You need to go to a hospital, the school nurse, something."</s>
 <s id="39">He's like, "No, Miss, I'm not going.</s>
 <s id="40">I need to be in class because I need to graduate."</s>
 <s id="41">So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance, but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.</s>
 <s id="42">And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families -- I wanted that, but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids, and teachers turning over year after year after year.</s>
 <s id="43">How do you get to build those relationships?</s>
 <s id="44">So we created a new school.</s>
 <s id="45">And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.</s>
 <s id="46">And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding, for support.</s>
 <s id="47">But with that, we were going to gain freedom: freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective; freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no; and freedom to control a budget, to spend money where it matters, not how a district or a state says you have to do it.</s>
 <s id="48">We wanted those freedoms.</s>
 <s id="49">But now, shifting an entire paradigm, it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.</s>
 <s id="50">But we had to do it.</s>
 <s id="51">Our community deserved a new way of doing things.</s>
 <s id="52">And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District, you better believe there was some opposition.</s>
 <s id="53">And it was out of fear -- fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?</s>
 <s id="54">Yeah, what if we get it wrong?</s>
 <s id="55">But what if we get it right?</s>
 <s id="56">And we did.</s>
 <s id="57">So even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts -- you can't teach, or you don't want to teach, you don't get to be at my school with my kids.</s>
 <s id="58">(Applause) So in our third year, how did we do it?</s>
 <s id="59">Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.</s>
 <s id="60">We make our kids feel like they matter to us.</s>
 <s id="61">We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them, and they use all the technology that they're used to.</s>
 <s id="62">Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.</s>
 <s id="63">Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.</s>
 <s id="64">And because we connect it to what they're doing â€” For example, they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society.</s>
 <s id="65">These were played in the local trolley system.</s>
 <s id="66">Teaching elements of persuasion, it doesn't get any more real than that.</s>
 <s id="67">Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we've become our own school.</s>
 <s id="68">But it's taken all stakeholders, working together -- teachers and principals on one-year contracts, working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation.</s>
 <s id="69">And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say, "Know, the district is trying to impose this, but you have the freedom to do otherwise."</s>
 <s id="70">And it takes an active parent center who is not only there, showing a presence every day, but who is part of our governance, making decisions for their kids, our kids.</s>
 <s id="71">Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live?</s>
 <s id="72">They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well, and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.</s>
 <s id="73">Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception, and we become the norm.</s>
 <s id="74">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="75">(Applause)</s>
