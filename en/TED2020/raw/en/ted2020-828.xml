 <s id="1">First of all, I'm a geek.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm an organic food-eating, carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.</s>
 <s id="3">And I really want to build green, but I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data, telling me how to do these kinds of things.</s>
 <s id="4">And so I have to figure this out for myself.</s>
 <s id="5">For example: Is this evil?</s>
 <s id="6">I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">But can I use a paper towel?</s>
  <s id="7.2">(Laughter) The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water, and every time I use a paper towel, I am using this much virtual energy and water.</s>
 <s id="9">Wipe it up, throw it away.</s>
 <s id="10">Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times, I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy until I wash that yogurty towel.</s>
 <s id="11">This is now operating energy.</s>
 <s id="12">So if I throw my towel in the washing machine, I've now put energy and water back into that towel ...</s>
 <s id="13">unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter) and then it looks a little bit better.</s>
 <s id="14">But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets?</s>
 <s id="15">Well, now a paper towel looks better.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">Screw the paper towels.</s>
  <s id="16.2">Let's go to a sponge.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water, and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.</s>
 <s id="18">Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on, and then you start to use more energy.</s>
 <s id="19">Or worse, you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel.</s>
 <s id="20">And now all bets are off.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) So what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect -- the position in which you put the handle -- have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize.</s>
 <s id="22">Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house.</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) That's what my husband and I are doing right now.</s>
 <s id="24">And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?</s>
 <s id="25">And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.</s>
 <s id="26">And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.</s>
 <s id="27">Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels.</s>
 <s id="28">We wanted to know how much better we could do.</s>
 <s id="29">And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.</s>
 <s id="30">So first, we demolish it.</s>
 <s id="31">It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart, you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back.</s>
 <s id="32">We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent.</s>
 <s id="33">And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar.</s>
 <s id="34">Now, you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25 percent by using high fly ash concrete.</s>
 <s id="35">We then put in framing.</s>
 <s id="36">And so this is framing -- lumber, composite materials -- and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC-certified lumber.</s>
 <s id="37">We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising.</s>
 <s id="38">If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there.</s>
 <s id="39">Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose.</s>
 <s id="40">We then put in plumbing, electrical and HVAC, and insulate.</s>
 <s id="41">Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy, and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that.</s>
 <s id="42">We also used straw bale infill for our library, which has zero embodied energy.</s>
 <s id="43">When it comes time to sheetrock, if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.</s>
 <s id="44">And then you get to the finishes, the subject of all of those "go green" articles, and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all.</s>
 <s id="45">And yet, all the press is focused on that.</s>
 <s id="46">Except for flooring.</s>
 <s id="47">If you put carpeting in your house, it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house, unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy.</s>
 <s id="48">So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.</s>
 <s id="49">But before we pat ourselves too much on the back, we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before.</s>
 <s id="50">And so the question is: How could we make that back?</s>
 <s id="51">And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward, compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house, we make it back in about six years.</s>
 <s id="52">Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy-efficient, and in that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even.</s>
 <s id="53">Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy, it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house.</s>
 <s id="54">So what does this mean?</s>
 <s id="55">On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year, it's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian.</s>
 <s id="56">But my elephant in the living room flies.</s>
 <s id="57">Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.</s>
 <s id="58">But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog.</s>
 <s id="59">And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are.</s>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">Thank you.</s>
  <s id="60.2">(Applause)</s>
