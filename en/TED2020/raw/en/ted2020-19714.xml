 <s id="1">Holding hands, we watched the door, boring holes in it with our intense stares.</s>
 <s id="2">My siblings and I were waiting for our mom to come back from the hospital, where my grandmother was having surgery for advanced cancer.</s>
 <s id="3">Finally, the doors opened, and my mom said, "She didn't survive the operation."</s>
 <s id="4">She burst into tears and between sobs, said, "Your grandmother's last wish was to be buried in her home, in Korea."</s>
 <s id="5">I was only 12 when this happened, and when I recovered from the initial shock, my mom's words echoed in my ears: Grandma wanted to be buried in her "home."</s>
 <s id="6">We had emigrated from Korea to Argentina six years earlier.</s>
 <s id="7">We knew no Spanish, or how we were going to make a living.</s>
 <s id="8">We were immigrants in a new land, where we had lost everything on account of a scam, and we had worked very hard to rebuild our lives.</s>
 <s id="9">That's why I couldn't imagine that after so many years, our home would still be Korea.</s>
 <s id="10">It made me wonder: Where do I want to be buried someday?</s>
 <s id="11">Where is my home?</s>
 <s id="12">To be honest, I didn't have an answer to these questions, and that really worried me.</s>
 <s id="13">This episode triggered an existential search for my identity.</s>
 <s id="14">I was born in Korea, the land of kimchi, and I grew up in Argentina, where there was always meat on the table; truly, it would not be surprising if today I were 80 percent cow.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) I was educated in the United States, where I became addicted to peanut butter.</s>
 <s id="16">During childhood, I honestly felt very Argentine, but my appearance always gave me away.</s>
 <s id="17">I remember the first day of high school, my literature teacher entered the classroom, carefully looked at everyone, stopped in front of me and prophesized: "You won't pass this class unless you get a private tutor."</s>
 <s id="18">But by then, I was speaking perfect Spanish -- better than I speak it now, I think, because it's been years since I left.</s>
 <s id="19">And I felt forced to choose between my Argentine identity and my Korean one.</s>
 <s id="20">Apparently, I couldn't be both, and I had to abandon my previous identity in order to adopt the new one.</s>
 <s id="21">So when I turned 18, I went to Korea to see if I could find this home that I could call my place in the world.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">In Korea, people assumed I was a foreigner, and they'd ask me, “Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish accent?”</s>
  <s id="22.2">(Laughter) Apparently, I was too Korean to be Argentine, but too Argentine to be Korean.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">Realizing that, honestly, was very transformative.</s>
 <s id="24">I decided not to try and change what I can't change and accept it.</s>
 <s id="25">In fact, I was inspired by one of my grandmother's stories.</s>
 <s id="26">My grandmother never learned Spanish, but she was very independent and managed on her own.</s>
 <s id="27">She would walk all around the streets of Buenos Aires, even in the most dangerous areas.</s>
 <s id="28">One afternoon, she was attacked and threatened at gunpoint.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">They put the gun to her head and said, "The ring!</s>
  <s id="29.2">The ring!</s>
  <s id="29.3">Give me your ring!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">They wanted her gold ring, which was her most prized possession back then.</s>
 <s id="31">Well, my grandmother looked the criminal in the eyes, sat down on the sidewalk, and a peaceful smile came onto her face.</s>
 <s id="32">My grandmother thought they were saying "anyó" instead of "ring," which in Korean, means "sit down."</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) She thought, "Well, it's the last day of my life, so if I'm leaving, let's leave with a smile."</s>
 <s id="34">She gracefully accepted her fate.</s>
 <s id="35">Imagine the face of her attacker -- he must have thought my poor grandmother was a creature from another planet, and he took off running, bewildered.</s>
 <s id="36">That experience inspired me to accept my new reality with optimism.</s>
 <s id="37">I hadn't managed to find that place in the world that I could call home.</s>
 <s id="38">But then I wondered: How many Koreans with Latino mannerisms that speak Korean with a Spanish accent are there in the world?</s>
 <s id="39">Maybe it could be an advantage, a useful tool, a way to stand out in a world where things are changing very quickly, where qualities and abilities can sometimes become obsolete from one day to the next.</s>
 <s id="40">So I decided not to focus on having 100 percent in common with people I met, Instead, I realized that I was frequently the only intersection between groups of people that didn't have much in common and that were even, at times, in conflict among themselves.</s>
 <s id="41">So with this new perspective, I proudly accepted the different versions of myself and even, at times, allowed me to reinvent myself.</s>
 <s id="42">For example, I have to confess that in high school I was what we call a bookworm -- I had thick glasses, had no fashion sense whatsoever.</s>
 <s id="43">What's more, I think the only reason I had friends was because I let them copy my homework every morning.</s>
 <s id="44">That's true.</s>
 <s id="45">Once I went to college, I was able to find a new identity, and the "worm" became a popular girl.</s>
 <s id="46">OK, granted, it was MIT, so I don't think the bar was very high -- (Laughter) but at least I could maintain that identity.</s>
 <s id="47">I changed majors so many times that my advisor told me that instead of chemical engineering, I should get a degree in random studies.</s>
 <s id="48">(Laughter) Over the years, I've had a lot of identities: academic, scientist, social innovator, inventor entrepreneur, investor; most recently, networker, teacher and, most importantly, a mother, three years ago.</s>
 <s id="49">I was so confused that even my accent couldn't decide who it was.</s>
 <s id="50">My friends would joke and say that it was of such an unknown origin that I was the only person in the world who spoke this language, "Rebecanese."</s>
 <s id="51">Reinventing oneself can be hard.</s>
 <s id="52">For example, when I was finishing my doctorate, I was bitten by the entrepreneurship bug.</s>
 <s id="53">So suddenly, writing a 400-page thesis in an office in a basement seemed less appealing than starting my own company.</s>
 <s id="54">So I had the job of telling this to my parents, who are traditional Asian immigrants -- whereas my siblings and I are the first to attend college -- in other words, that education is the most important thing in my family.</s>
 <s id="55">You can imagine the reaction awaiting me upon telling my parents I was abandoning my studies.</s>
 <s id="56">So I went to my parents, but with a secret weapon: a chart showing the average income of people who graduated with doctorates from Stanford compared to the average incomes of Stanford students who abandoned their thesis or doctorate.</s>
 <s id="57">Now, I have to confess that the chart was really skewed by the founders of Google.</s>
 <s id="58">(Laughter) My mom looked at the chart and without blinking, said, "I've always said you should follow your heart."</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) My search for identity these days isn't about finding my tribe.</s>
 <s id="60">Really, it's about finding and accepting all the different possible permutations of myself.</s>
 <s id="61">It's about cultivating diversity within myself, instead of just around me.</s>
 <s id="62">Currently, my kids are three years old and six months old, just turned, and they were born into three nationalities and four languages -- and I need to clarify that I married a Danish guy, in case I didn't have enough cultural confusion in my life, I ended up marrying a Viking.</s>
 <s id="63">I think my kids will be the only Vikings that won't be able to grow a beard when they grow up.</s>
 <s id="64">It'll be hard for them.</s>
 <s id="65">(Laughter) I hope that my kids will have a multidimensionality that works for them; that they see it as a tool for creating connections in a world that's every day more global and also more divided.</s>
 <s id="66">I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried that they don't fit into a predefined box, that they can feel free to experiment and take control of their life narratives in their own way.</s>
 <s id="67">I hope they can use the unique combination of values, cultures, languages and abilities that they have to create a world where their identities are used to unite peoples and people, and not as an excuse to generate intolerance -- because identity can be a double-edged sword: we can use it to differentiate ourselves from others, or to find points of connection.</s>
 <s id="68">And when we accept our multiplicity, we amplify this power of connection and forget about the differences a little.</s>
 <s id="69">Now, back to my grandmother: her last wish was also her final life lesson for me.</s>
 <s id="70">It turns out that after many years, I found out why she wanted to be buried in Korea.</s>
 <s id="71">It wasn't a question of patriotism or nationality.</s>
 <s id="72">She wanted to rest in peace next to her son, who had died many years before she emigrated to Argentina.</s>
 <s id="73">My grandmother lived a life full of deep connections and indestructible ties, including those separated by distances or oceans or even death.</s>
 <s id="74">She had many identities: matriarch, farmer, businesswoman, Korean, immigrant, mother, grandmother.</s>
 <s id="75">With her last wish, she taught me that finding our home isn't about putting down roots somewhere.</s>
 <s id="76">It's about intertwining those roots with the roots of others who enrich our lives.</s>
 <s id="77">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="78">(Applause)</s>
