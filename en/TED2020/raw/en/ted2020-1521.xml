 <s id="1">I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.</s>
 <s id="2">And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well.</s>
 <s id="3">When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes, I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.</s>
 <s id="4">I'm not connecting to them.</s>
 <s id="5">Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up.</s>
 <s id="6">I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">How many of you out there suffer from -- yes.</s>
  <s id="7.2">Ha ha, ha ha!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">Now, sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes, or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it.</s>
  <s id="8.2">And do you have the accompanying guilt?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">For me, I look at the paintings on the wall and I think, somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it.</s>
 <s id="10">In fact, most of the time I don't see it.</s>
 <s id="11">And I leave feeling actually unhappy.</s>
 <s id="12">I feel guilty and unhappy with myself, rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting, I think there's something wrong with me.</s>
 <s id="13">And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.</s>
 <s id="15">If you think about going into a restaurant, when you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">No!</s>
  <s id="16.2">You select.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">If you go into a department store to buy a shirt, are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">Of course not, you can be selective.</s>
  <s id="18.2">It's expected.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">How come, then, it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery?</s>
 <s id="20">Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?</s>
 <s id="21">Well I'm trying to take a different approach.</s>
 <s id="22">And there's two things I do: When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other.</s>
 <s id="23">I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.</s>
 <s id="24">So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">I choose a painting.</s>
  <s id="25.2">It might just be one painting in 50.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting, and I tell myself a story about it.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">Why a story?</s>
  <s id="27.2">Well, I think that we are wired, our DNA tells us to tell stories.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">We tell stories all the time about everything, and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place, and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it.</s>
 <s id="29">Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?</s>
 <s id="30">So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries.</s>
 <s id="31">There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them.</s>
 <s id="32">The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter.</s>
 <s id="33">This is the most glorious painting.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster.</s>
  <s id="34.2">30 years later it's hanging in my house.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone, I never tire of looking at her.</s>
 <s id="36">What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with was just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face.</s>
 <s id="37">But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing, and that is the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.</s>
 <s id="38">I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time.</s>
 <s id="39">So that keeps me coming back.</s>
 <s id="40">One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall, I lay in bed and looked at her, and I suddenly thought, I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that.</s>
 <s id="41">And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him.</s>
 <s id="42">Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.</s>
 <s id="43">Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.</s>
 <s id="44">And I thought, well, what is that relationship?</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">So I went to find out.</s>
  <s id="45.2">I did some research and discovered, we have no idea who she is.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">In fact, we don't know who any of the models in any of Vermeer's paintings are, and we know very little about Vermeer himself.</s>
 <s id="47">Which made me go, "Yippee!"</s>
 <s id="48">I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.</s>
 <s id="49">So here's how I came up with the story.</s>
 <s id="50">First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house.</s>
 <s id="51">How does Vermeer know her?</s>
 <s id="52">Well, there've been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter.</s>
 <s id="53">The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.</s>
 <s id="54">And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look, but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.</s>
 <s id="55">For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time, if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.</s>
 <s id="56">It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that.</s>
 <s id="57">So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him.</s>
 <s id="58">Well, who else would be in the house?</s>
 <s id="59">A servant, a lovely servant.</s>
 <s id="60">So, she's in the house.</s>
 <s id="61">How do we get her into the studio?</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room where he -- his studio.</s>
  <s id="62.2">He also had 11 children.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.</s>
 <s id="64">And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before, you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.</s>
 <s id="65">How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?</s>
 <s id="66">Well, he compartmentalizes his life.</s>
 <s id="67">He gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.</s>
 <p id="p68">
  <s id="68.1">Not the wife, not the kids.</s>
  <s id="68.2">Okay, the maid can come in and clean."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">She's in the studio.</s>
  <s id="69.2">He's got her in the studio, they're together.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">And he decides to paint her.</s>
 <s id="71">He has her wear very plain clothes.</s>
 <s id="72">Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.</s>
 <s id="73">This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring.</s>
 <s id="74">Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.</s>
 <p id="p75">
  <s id="75.1">So those are not her pearl earrings.</s>
  <s id="75.2">Whose are they?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="76">We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.</s>
 <s id="77">Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings, different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.</s>
 <s id="78">So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.</s>
 <s id="79">It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.</s>
 <s id="80">So we've got all the elements for our story.</s>
 <s id="81">She's in the studio with him for a long time.</s>
 <s id="82">These paintings took a long time to make.</s>
 <s id="83">They would have spent the time alone, all that time.</s>
 <s id="84">She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">She's gorgeous.</s>
  <s id="85.2">She obviously loves him.</s>
  <s id="85.3">She's conflicted.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p86">
  <s id="86.1">And does the wife know?</s>
  <s id="86.2">Maybe not.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="87">And if she doesn't, well -- that's the story.</s>
 <s id="88">(Laughter) The next painting I'm going to talk about is called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.</s>
 <s id="89">He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people.</s>
 <s id="90">And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.</s>
 <s id="91">I like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.</s>
 <s id="92">He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.</s>
 <s id="93">He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.</s>
 <p id="p94">
  <s id="94.1">And I looked at his face.</s>
  <s id="94.2">It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light.</s>
  <s id="95.2">It's right in the center of the painting, and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it, I was standing there going, "Look at me.</s>
  <s id="95.3">Please look at me."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">And he didn't look at me.</s>
  <s id="96.2">He was still looking at his cards, and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is, he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="97">And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.</s>
 <s id="98">He's never going to look at me.</s>
 <s id="99">So I was thinking of a story where, if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?</s>
 <s id="100">Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.</s>
 <s id="101">I'm thinking of an older version of himself.</s>
 <p id="p102">
  <s id="102.1">He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant, saying, "Look at me.</s>
  <s id="102.2">I want to warn you about what you're about to go through.</s>
  <s id="102.3">Please look at me."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="103">And he never does.</s>
 <s id="104">And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad.</s>
 <s id="105">I've written an entire novel about her, and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.</s>
 <s id="106">Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.</s>
 <s id="107">And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again.</s>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.</s>
  <s id="108.2">(Laughter) This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="109">They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is.</s>
 <s id="110">Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.</s>
 <s id="111">They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.</s>
 <s id="112">So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage, along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings.</s>
 <s id="113">This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons: One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.</s>
 <s id="114">He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?</s>
 <s id="115">The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.</s>
 <p id="p116">
  <s id="116.1">He is blushing.</s>
  <s id="116.2">He's blushing for his portrait being made!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="117">This must be a guy who blushes all the time.</s>
 <s id="118">What is he thinking about that's making him blush?</s>
 <s id="119">The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.</s>
 <s id="120">Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.</s>
 <s id="121">And you know what it makes me think of, is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.</s>
 <s id="122">I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks, and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him, and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?</s>
 <s id="123">And I thought, if I'm going to make a story, what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?</s>
 <s id="124">Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?</s>
 <s id="125">And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.</s>
 <s id="126">He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.</s>
 <s id="127">Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?</s>
 <s id="128">You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.</s>
 <s id="129">Now, here's the story.</s>
 <s id="130">It's short.</s>
 <s id="131">"Rosy" I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.</s>
 <s id="132">It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread, set close together so that the fit is snug.</s>
 <s id="133">The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.</s>
 <s id="134">Perhaps that was the intention.</s>
 <s id="135">I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.</s>
 <s id="136">I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed.</s>
 <s id="137">I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion, from wine, from high emotion.</s>
 <s id="138">As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys, but not by George.</s>
 <s id="139">Only George could call me Rosy.</s>
 <s id="140">I would not allow anyone else.</s>
 <s id="141">He managed to make the word tender.</s>
 <s id="142">When I made the announcement, George did not turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.</s>
 <s id="143">He should not have been surprised.</s>
 <s id="144">It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin.</s>
 <s id="145">But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.</s>
 <s id="146">I know, I could barely utter them.</s>
 <s id="147">Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.</s>
 <s id="148">Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.</s>
 <s id="149">We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.</s>
 <p id="p150">
  <s id="150.1">"What do you think of my doublet?"</s>
  <s id="150.2">I asked.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p151">
  <s id="151.1">He glanced at me.</s>
  <s id="151.2">"That collar looks to be strangling you."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="152">"We will still see each other," I insisted.</s>
 <s id="153">"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.</s>
 <s id="154">Nothing need change."</s>
 <s id="155">George did not speak.</s>
 <p id="p156">
  <s id="156.1">"I am 23 years old.</s>
  <s id="156.2">It is time for me to marry and produce an heir.</s>
  <s id="156.3">It is expected of me."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="157">George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.</s>
 <s id="158">"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.</s>
 <s id="159">I'm sure you'll be content together."</s>
 <s id="160">He never used my nickname again.</s>
 <s id="161">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="162">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="163">(Applause)</s>
