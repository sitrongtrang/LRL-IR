 <s id="1">(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Thank you!</s>
 <s id="2">(Applause continues) Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="3">Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess.</s>
 <s id="4">I'm also the first time here, and ...</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) I don't know what to say!</s>
 <s id="6">(Applause) I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.</s>
 <s id="7">I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.</s>
 <s id="8">And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.</s>
 <s id="9">It's called "Kaleidoscope."</s>
 <s id="10">And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.</s>
 <s id="11">I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.</s>
 <s id="12">It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer.</s>
 <s id="13">The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G, and that's the main theme in the melody.</s>
 <s id="14">(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G) That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) But he wrote that for his wife.</s>
 <s id="16">(Laughter) So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.</s>
 <s id="17">It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.</s>
 <s id="18">(Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Now comes the part that I hate.</s>
 <s id="19">Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called "Sync and Flow," I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) So, I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.</s>
 <s id="21">How do I compose?</s>
 <s id="22">I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.</s>
 <s id="23">What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano -- and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the Abegg that you just heard.</s>
 <s id="24">And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide: Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?</s>
 <s id="25">And this year, I composed a Romantic style.</s>
 <s id="26">So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great Romantic composers.</s>
 <s id="27">Next, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.</s>
 <s id="28">They help me plan out the whole piece.</s>
 <s id="29">And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas, because then you have to think.</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) And then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form -- solidified, excuse me -- solidified form, you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details, and then polish the overall performance of the composition.</s>
 <s id="31">And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.</s>
 <s id="32">Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.</s>
 <s id="33">I think that's a craze among teens right now.</s>
 <s id="34">And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing, it's your character -- you want to decide who you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character.</s>
 <s id="35">And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">Like, am I going to use one page?</s>
  <s id="36.2">Am I going to draw it on the computer?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?</s>
 <s id="38">For a more grandiose effect, I guess.</s>
 <s id="39">And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece, and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need -- that's polishing the drawing.</s>
 <s id="40">And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind, because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.</s>
 <s id="41">So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.</s>
 <s id="42">And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all, and then it's like there's too much on your mind.</s>
 <s id="43">You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.</s>
 <s id="44">And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.</s>
 <s id="45">What happens is, if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly, and then that's what I consider "flow," because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.</s>
 <s id="46">You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.</s>
 <s id="47">I'm not going to play my own composition today because, although I did finish it, it's way too long.</s>
 <s id="48">Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."</s>
 <s id="49">I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet.</s>
 <s id="50">And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five -- anyone to come up here and choose five -- and then I can make it into some sort of melody, and I'll improvise it.</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">Wow.</s>
  <s id="51.2">A volunteer, yay!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">(Laughter) (Applause) Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.</s>
 <p id="p53">
  <s id="53.1">Goldie Hawn: Thank you.</s>
  <s id="53.2">Choose five?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p54">
  <s id="54.1">JL: Yes, five cards.</s>
  <s id="54.2">Any five cards.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">GH: OK, one.</s>
  <s id="55.2">JL: OK.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">GH: Two.</s>
  <s id="56.2">JL: Yes.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">GH: Three.</s>
 <s id="58">GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">(Laughter) JL: One more.</s>
  <s id="59.2">GH: OK.</s>
  <s id="59.3">"E" for "effort."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">JL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?</s>
 <s id="61">GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.</s>
 <s id="62">JL: Thank you very much!</s>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">GH: You're welcome.</s>
  <s id="63.2">And what about these?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">JL: I won't use them.</s>
  <s id="64.2">Thank you!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">(Applause) Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.</s>
 <s id="66">I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.</s>
 <s id="67">(Plays notes) OK, that's nice.</s>
 <s id="68">So, I'm going to have a moment to think, and I'll try to make something out of it.</s>
 <s id="69">(Plays the five notes) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) The next song, or the encore that I'm going to play is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.</s>
 <s id="70">(Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause)</s>
