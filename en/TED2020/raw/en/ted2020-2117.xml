 <s id="1">Humanity takes center stage at TED, but I would like to add a voice for the animals, whose bodies and minds and spirits shaped us.</s>
 <s id="2">Some years ago, it was my good fortune to meet a tribal elder on an island not far from Vancouver.</s>
 <s id="3">His name is Jimmy Smith, and he shared a story with me that is told among his people, who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.</s>
 <s id="4">Once upon a time, he told me, all animals on Earth were one.</s>
 <s id="5">Even though they look different on the outside, inside, they're all the same, and from time to time they would gather at a sacred cave deep inside the forest to celebrate their unity.</s>
 <s id="6">When they arrived, they would all take off their skins.</s>
 <s id="7">Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur, and salmon her scales, and then, they would dance.</s>
 <s id="8">But one day, a human made it to the cave and laughed at what he saw because he did not understand.</s>
 <s id="9">Embarrassed, the animals fled, and that was the last time they revealed themselves this way.</s>
 <s id="10">The ancient understanding that underneath their separate identities, all animals are one, has been a powerful inspiration to me.</s>
 <s id="11">I like to get past the fur, the feathers and the scales.</s>
 <s id="12">I want to get under the skin.</s>
 <s id="13">No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant or a tiny tree frog, my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.</s>
 <s id="14">You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">Sure.</s>
  <s id="15.2">People are always present in my photos, no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">You just have to learn how to look past their disguise.</s>
 <s id="17">As a photographer, I try to reach beyond the differences in our genetic makeup to appreciate all we have in common with every other living thing.</s>
 <s id="18">When I use my camera, I drop my skin like the animals at that cave so I can show who they really are.</s>
 <s id="19">As animals blessed with the power of rational thought, we can marvel at the intricacies of life.</s>
 <s id="20">As citizens of a planet in trouble, it is our moral responsibility to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.</s>
 <s id="21">But as humans with hearts, we can all rejoice in the unity of life, and perhaps we can change what once happened in that sacred cave.</s>
 <s id="22">Let's find a way to join the dance.</s>
 <s id="23">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="24">(Applause)</s>
