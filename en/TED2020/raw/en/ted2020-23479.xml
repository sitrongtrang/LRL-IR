 <s id="1">A high forehead topped by disheveled black hair, a sickly pallor, and a look of deep intelligence and deeper exhaustion in his dark, sunken eyes.</s>
 <s id="2">Edgar Allan Poe’s image is not just instantly recognizable – it’s perfectly suited to his reputation.</s>
 <s id="3">From the prisoner strapped under a descending pendulum blade, to a raven who refuses to leave the narrator’s chamber, Poe’s macabre and innovative stories of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature.</s>
 <s id="4">But just what is it that makes Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors?</s>
 <s id="5">After all, horror was a popular genre of the period, with many practitioners.</s>
 <s id="6">Yet Poe stood out thanks to his careful attention to form and style.</s>
 <s id="7">As a literary critic, he identified two cardinal rules for the short story form: it must be short enough to read in one sitting, and every word must contribute to its purpose.</s>
 <s id="8">By mastering these rules, Poe commands the reader’s attention and rewards them with an intense and singular experience – what Poe called the unity of effect.</s>
 <s id="9">Though often frightening, this effect goes far beyond fear.</s>
 <s id="10">Poe’s stories use violence and horror to explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love, grief, and guilt, while resisting simple interpretations or clear moral messages.</s>
 <s id="11">And while they often hint at supernatural elements, the true darkness they explore is the human mind and its propensity for self-destruction.</s>
 <s id="12">In “The Tell-Tale Heart,” a ghastly murder is juxtaposed with the killer’s tender empathy towards the victim – a connection that soon returns to haunt him.</s>
 <s id="13">The title character of "Ligeia" returns from the dead through the corpse of her husband’s second wife – or at least the opium-addicted narrator thinks she does.</s>
 <s id="14">And when the protagonist of “William Wilson” violently confronts a man he believes has been following him, he might just be staring at his own image in a mirror.</s>
 <s id="15">Through his pioneering use of unreliable narrators, Poe turns readers into active participants who must decide when a storyteller might be misinterpreting or even lying about the events they’re relating.</s>
 <s id="16">Although he’s best known for his short horror stories, Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writers of the nineteenth century.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">He invented the detective story as we know it, with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget” and “The Purloined Letter.”</s>
  <s id="17.2">All three feature the original armchair detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who uses his genius and unusual powers of observation and deduction to solve crimes that baffle the police.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">Poe also wrote satires of social and literary trends, and hoaxes that in some cases anticipated science fiction.</s>
 <s id="19">Those included an account of a balloon voyage to the moon, and a report of a dying patient put into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side.</s>
 <s id="20">Poe even wrote an adventure novel about a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophysics, all while he worked as an editor, producing hundreds of pages of book reviews and literary theory.</s>
 <s id="21">An appreciation of Poe’s career wouldn’t be complete without his poetry: haunting and hypnotic.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">His best-known poems are songs of grief, or in his words, “mournful and never-ending remembrance.”</s>
  <s id="22.2">“The Raven,” in which the speaker projects his grief onto a bird who merely repeats a single sound, made Poe famous.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">But despite his literary success, Poe lived in poverty throughout his career, and his personal life was often as dark as his writing.</s>
 <s id="24">He was haunted by the loss of his mother and his wife, who both died of tuberculosis at the age of 24.</s>
 <s id="25">Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized other popular writers.</s>
 <s id="26">Much of his fame came from posthumous – and very loose – adaptations of his work.</s>
 <s id="27">And yet, if he could’ve known how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations of readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought a smile to that famously brooding visage.</s>
