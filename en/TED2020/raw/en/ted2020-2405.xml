 <s id="1">A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails.</s>
 <s id="2">And it managed to get through my spam filter.</s>
 <s id="3">I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) I know.</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) It went like this: it said, "Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."</s>
 <s id="6">Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">I was looking at my phone.</s>
  <s id="7.2">I thought, I could just delete this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."</s>
 <s id="10">(Laughter) (Applause) And the game was afoot.</s>
 <s id="11">He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."</s>
 <s id="12">(Laughter) "You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) So I knew I was dealing with a professional.</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) I said, "How much is it worth?"</s>
 <s id="15">He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, "of 25 kgs.</s>
 <s id="16">(Laughter) The worth should be about $2.5 million."</s>
 <s id="17">I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">(Applause) I can handle it.</s>
  <s id="18.2">How much gold do you have?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling.</s>
 <s id="20">We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."</s>
 <s id="21">I said, "50 kgs?</s>
 <s id="22">There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton."</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) (Applause) He said, "What do you do for a living?"</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."</s>
 <s id="25">(Laughter) This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no.</s>
 <s id="26">Then I started to panic.</s>
 <s id="27">I was like, "Where are you based?"</s>
 <s id="28">I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for.</s>
 <s id="29">That's a lot of gold."</s>
 <s id="30">He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment."</s>
 <s id="31">I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.</s>
 <s id="32">I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.</s>
 <s id="33">Hold tight."</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) This is what I sent Solomon.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) (Applause) I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.</s>
 <s id="37">I've had one of my assistants run the numbers.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."</s>
 <s id="39">There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon.</s>
 <s id="40">He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well."</s>
 <s id="41">And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"</s>
 <s id="42">And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"</s>
 <s id="43">I thought about it for a long time.</s>
 <s id="44">And I said, "One word; Hummus."</s>
 <s id="45">(Laughter) "It's going places.</s>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties.</s>
 <s id="47">Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.</s>
 <s id="48">Have you ever done that, Solomon?"</s>
 <s id="49">(Laughter) He said, "I have to go bed now."</s>
 <s id="50">(Laughter) (Applause) "Till morrow.</s>
 <s id="51">Have sweet dream."</s>
 <s id="52">I didn't know what to say!</s>
 <s id="53">I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head.</s>
 <s id="55">It was getting a bit out of hand.</s>
 <s id="56">Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"</s>
 <s id="57">I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."</s>
 <s id="58">So I figured I had to knock it on the head.</s>
 <s id="59">I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.</s>
 <s id="60">So I concocted a plan.</s>
 <s id="61">I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.</s>
 <s id="62">When we email each other, we need to use a code."</s>
 <s id="63">And he agreed.</s>
 <s id="64">(Laughter) I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: Lawyer: Gummy Bear.</s>
 <s id="65">Bank: Cream Egg.</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.</s>
  <s id="66.2">Claim: Peanut M&amp;amp;Ms.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="67">Documents: Jelly Beans.</s>
 <s id="68">Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."</s>
 <s id="69">(Laughter) I knew these were all words they use, right?</s>
 <s id="70">I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">(Laughter) I didn't hear back.</s>
  <s id="71.2">I thought, I've gone too far.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">I've gone too far.</s>
  <s id="72.2">So I had to backpedal a little.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?</s>
 <s id="74">KitKat."</s>
 <s id="75">(Laughter) Because you have to be consistent.</s>
 <s id="76">Then I did get an email back from him.</s>
 <s id="77">He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."</s>
 <s id="78">I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"</s>
 <s id="79">What followed is the greatest email I've ever received.</s>
 <s id="80">(Laughter) I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.</s>
 <s id="81">This was a good day.</s>
 <s id="82">"The business is on.</s>
 <s id="83">I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear -- (Laughter) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;amp;Ms process to start.</s>
 <s id="84">(Laughter) Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard."</s>
 <s id="85">(Applause) And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could?</s>
 <s id="86">And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf.</s>
 <s id="87">(Laughter) (Applause) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.</s>
 <s id="88">It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it.</s>
 <s id="89">I don't think what I'm doing is mean.</s>
 <s id="90">There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.</s>
 <s id="91">All I'm doing is wasting their time.</s>
 <s id="92">And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right?</s>
 <s id="93">And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address.</s>
 <s id="94">Don't use your own email address.</s>
 <s id="95">That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.</s>
 <s id="96">I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response -- (Laughter) to a medical question I had.</s>
 <s id="97">But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: (Laughter) "I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."</s>
 <s id="98">I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.</s>
 <s id="99">(Laughter) I know so many.</s>
 <s id="100">"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."</s>
 <s id="101">Let that sink in.</s>
 <s id="102">She sent me this, which is hysterical.</s>
 <s id="103">(Laughter) And this.</s>
 <s id="104">And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.</s>
 <s id="105">But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!</s>
 <s id="106">(Laughter) I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.</s>
 <s id="107">Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."</s>
 <s id="108">(Laughter) That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.</s>
 <s id="109">She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.</s>
 <s id="110">ONE LOVE."</s>
 <p id="p111">
  <s id="111.1">(Laughter) I said, "Of course.</s>
  <s id="111.2">NO WOMAN, NO CRY."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">(Laughter) (Applause) She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS.</s>
  <s id="112.2">ONE LOVE."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) I said, "no problemo.</s>
 <s id="114">I SHOT THE SHERIFF."</s>
 <s id="115">[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] (Laughter) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="116">(Applause)</s>
