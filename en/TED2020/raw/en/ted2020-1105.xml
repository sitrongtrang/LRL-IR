 <s id="1">(Singing) (Singing ends) (Applause) Pep Rosenfeld: Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden.</s>
 <s id="2">She is a world-class soprano singer who studied in Rochester, New York.</s>
 <s id="3">Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied.</s>
 <s id="4">In August 2007, Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts, winning praise for her brilliance, her amazing and extensively wide repertoire and her vivid stage personality.</s>
 <s id="5">Please welcome Claron McFadden.</s>
 <s id="6">(Applause) Claron McFadden: The human voice: mysterious, spontaneous, primal.</s>
 <s id="7">For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel -- except, perhaps, jealousy.</s>
 <s id="8">And the breath, the breath is the captain of that vessel.</s>
 <s id="9">A child is born, takes its first breath -- (Inhales) Whah!</s>
 <s id="10">And we behold the wondrous beauty of vocal expression -- mysterious, spontaneous and primal.</s>
 <s id="11">A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.</s>
 <s id="12">I wanted a place where I would have total silence and total solitude.</s>
 <s id="13">I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut -- no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature, trying to find the essence of concentration, being in the moment.</s>
 <s id="14">On my last day, the woman who looked after the place, she came and we spoke for a minute, and then she said to me, "Would you sing something for me?"</s>
 <s id="15">And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence.</s>
 <s id="16">I can't make noise.</s>
 <s id="17">She said, "Please, sing for me."</s>
 <s id="18">So I closed my eyes, I took breath and the first thing that came up and out was "Summertime," Porgy and Bess.</s>
 <s id="19">(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy.</s>
 <s id="20">Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.</s>
 <s id="21">Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'.</s>
 <s id="22">So hush little baby, don't you cry.</s>
 <s id="23">And I opened my eyes, and I saw that she had her eyes closed.</s>
 <s id="24">And after a moment, she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said, "It's like meditation."</s>
 <s id="25">And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing -- the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment.</s>
 <s id="26">When you're totally in the moment -- when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open.</s>
 <s id="27">The emotions can flow from me to you and back.</s>
 <s id="28">It's an extremely profound experience.</s>
 <s id="29">There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.</s>
 <s id="30">It's called "Aria."</s>
 <s id="31">It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian.</s>
 <s id="32">And the thing about this piece that's so special -- if you see it behind me -- it's not notated in any way.</s>
 <s id="33">No notes, no flats, no sharps.</s>
 <s id="34">But it's a kind of structure.</s>
 <s id="35">And the singer, within this structure, has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.</s>
 <s id="36">For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop, country and western, opera, jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color.</s>
 <s id="37">You see there are different lines.</s>
 <s id="38">You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less.</s>
 <s id="39">And these little dots, these represent a sort of sound that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">Using the body -- it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, animals -- (Audience member coughs) Exactly.</s>
  <s id="40.2">(Laughter) Clapping, whatever.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="41">And there's different text.</s>
 <s id="42">There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.</s>
 <s id="43">So within this structure, one is free.</s>
 <s id="44">To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see.</s>
 <s id="45">It's quite spontaneous.</s>
 <s id="46">And it's primal.</s>
 <s id="47">So I would like to share this piece with you, It's "Aria," of John Cage.</s>
 <s id="48">(Singing in various languages) Hampart-zoum Dirouhi Di questa Terra Naprasno Conscience et (Barks) (Singing) Arise Tsk, tsk, tsk.</s>
