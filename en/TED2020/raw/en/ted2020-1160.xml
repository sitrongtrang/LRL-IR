 <s id="1">This is a representation of your brain, and your brain can be broken into two parts.</s>
 <s id="2">There's the left half, which is the logical side, and then the right half, which is the intuitive.</s>
 <s id="3">And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere, then we can plot our brain.</s>
 <s id="4">And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.</s>
 <s id="5">This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.</s>
 <s id="6">So where would you put your brain on this scale?</s>
 <s id="7">Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes, but I think for most people in the audience, your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.</s>
 <s id="8">It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.</s>
 <s id="9">You can be logical and intuitive.</s>
 <s id="10">And so I consider myself one of these people, along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists, who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas.</s>
 <s id="11">But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">How do we develop this intuition?</s>
  <s id="12.2">Well we like to play with stuff.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there.</s>
 <s id="14">And really you do the same thing.</s>
 <s id="15">So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.</s>
 <s id="16">I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.</s>
 <s id="17">And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.</s>
 <s id="18">He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.</s>
 <s id="19">But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson, and that's that large things don't let you get right past them, and that they stay in one place.</s>
 <s id="20">And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world, unless you're a particle physicist.</s>
 <s id="21">It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car stops, they play with these little weird particles.</s>
 <s id="22">And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.</s>
 <s id="23">And so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.</s>
 <s id="24">And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles.</s>
 <s id="25">But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us.</s>
 <s id="26">This didn't really sit well with my intuition, and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.</s>
 <s id="27">Well, I play with them sometimes, but not very often.</s>
 <s id="28">And I've never seen them.</s>
 <s id="29">I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.</s>
 <s id="30">But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.</s>
 <s id="31">Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics, then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?</s>
 <s id="32">I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.</s>
 <s id="33">And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics.</s>
 <s id="34">So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.</s>
 <s id="35">So I made one.</s>
 <s id="36">This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.</s>
 <s id="37">So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip.</s>
 <s id="38">And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.</s>
 <s id="39">And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.</s>
 <s id="40">This is a photograph of the object.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">And here I'll zoom in a little bit.</s>
  <s id="41.2">We're looking right there in the center.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.</s>
 <s id="43">So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.</s>
 <s id="44">And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.</s>
 <s id="45">I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.</s>
 <s id="46">For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device.</s>
 <s id="47">This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it.</s>
 <s id="48">Here, let me give you an analogy.</s>
 <s id="49">You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?</s>
 <s id="50">I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them.</s>
 <s id="51">So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way.</s>
 <s id="52">The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.</s>
 <s id="53">And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.</s>
 <s id="54">And so that's what we did.</s>
 <s id="55">We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.</s>
 <s id="56">Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.</s>
 <s id="57">And so we measured its motion.</s>
 <s id="58">We found it was moving in really weird ways.</s>
 <s id="59">Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows.</s>
 <s id="60">And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.</s>
 <s id="61">So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.</s>
 <s id="62">What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time?</s>
 <s id="63">So let's think about the atoms.</s>
 <s id="64">So in one case: all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.</s>
 <s id="65">Now it's only at precise times when they align.</s>
 <s id="66">The rest of the time they're delocalized.</s>
 <s id="67">That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places.</s>
 <s id="68">I think this is really cool.</s>
 <s id="69">(Laughter) Really.</s>
 <s id="70">(Applause) It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because, check this out, the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you.</s>
 <s id="71">So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, that chunk of metal can be in two different places, then why not you?</s>
 <s id="72">I mean, this is just my logical side talking.</s>
 <s id="73">So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time, what would that be like?</s>
 <s id="74">How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space?</s>
 <s id="75">There's one more part to the story.</s>
 <s id="76">It's when we warmed it up, and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.</s>
 <s id="77">And so I had to develop this new intuition, that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space.</s>
 <s id="78">You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.</s>
 <s id="79">Well, that's not quite right.</s>
 <s id="80">It's more than that; it's deeper.</s>
 <s id="81">It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.</s>
 <s id="82">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="83">(Applause)</s>
