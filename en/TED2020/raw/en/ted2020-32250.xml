 <s id="1">In 1956, architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skyscraper.</s>
 <s id="2">It was going to be the world’s tallest building, by a lot — five times as high as the Eiffel Tower.</s>
 <s id="3">But many critics laughed at the architect, arguing that people would have to wait hours for an elevator, or worse, that the tower would collapse under its own weight.</s>
 <s id="4">Most engineers agreed, and despite the publicity around the proposal, the titanic tower was never built.</s>
 <s id="5">But today, bigger and bigger buildings are going up around the world.</s>
 <s id="6">Firms are even planning skyscrapers more than a kilometer tall, like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, three times the size of the Eiffel Tower.</s>
 <s id="7">Very soon, Wright’s mile-high miracle may be a reality.</s>
 <s id="8">So what exactly was stopping us from building these megastructures 70 years ago, and how do we build something a mile high today?</s>
 <s id="9">In any construction project, each story of the structure needs to be able to support the stories on top of it.</s>
 <s id="10">The higher we build, the higher the gravitational pressure from the upper stories on the lower ones.</s>
 <s id="11">This principle has long dictated the shape of our buildings, leading ancient architects to favor pyramids with wide foundations that support lighter upper levels.</s>
 <s id="12">But this solution doesn’t quite translate to a city skyline– a pyramid that tall would be roughly one-and-a-half miles wide, tough to squeeze into a city center.</s>
 <s id="13">Fortunately, strong materials like concrete can avoid this impractical shape.</s>
 <s id="14">And modern concrete blends are reinforced with steel-fibers for strength and water-reducing polymers to prevent cracking.</s>
 <s id="15">The concrete in the world’s tallest tower, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, can withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure per square meter– the weight of over 1,200 African elephants!</s>
 <s id="16">Of course, even if a building supports itself, it still needs support from the ground.</s>
 <s id="17">Without a foundation, buildings this heavy would sink, fall, or lean over.</s>
 <s id="18">To prevent the roughly half a million ton tower from sinking, 192 concrete and steel supports called piles were buried over 50 meters deep.</s>
 <s id="19">The friction between the piles and the ground keeps this sizable structure standing.</s>
 <s id="20">Besides defeating gravity, which pushes the building down, a skyscraper also needs to overcome the blowing wind, which pushes from the side.</s>
 <s id="21">On average days, wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force per square meter on a high-rise building– as heavy as a gust of bowling balls.</s>
 <s id="22">Designing structures to be aerodynamic, like China’s sleek Shanghai Tower, can reduce that force by up to a quarter.</s>
 <s id="23">And wind-bearing frames inside or outside the building can absorb the remaining wind force, such as in Seoul’s Lotte Tower.</s>
 <s id="24">But even after all these measures, you could still find yourself swaying back and forth more than a meter on top floors during a hurricane.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">To prevent the wind from rocking tower tops, many skyscrapers employ a counterweight weighing hundreds of tons called a “tuned mass damper.”</s>
  <s id="25.2">The Taipei 101, for instance, has suspended a giant metal orb above the 87th floor.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">When wind moves the building, this orb sways into action, absorbing the building’s kinetic energy.</s>
 <s id="27">As its movements trail the tower’s, hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert that kinetic energy into heat, and stabilize the swaying structure.</s>
 <s id="28">With all these technologies in place, our mega-structures can stay standing and stable.</s>
 <s id="29">But quickly traveling through buildings this large is a challenge in itself.</s>
 <s id="30">In Wright’s age, the fastest elevators moved a mere 22 kilometers per hour.</s>
 <s id="31">Thankfully, today’s elevators are much faster, traveling over 70 km per hour with future cabins potentially using frictionless magnetic rails for even higher speeds.</s>
 <s id="32">And traffic management algorithms group riders by destination to get passengers and empty cabins where they need to be.</s>
 <s id="33">Skyscrapers have come a long way since Wright proposed his mile-high tower.</s>
 <s id="34">What were once considered impossible ideas have become architectural opportunities.</s>
 <s id="35">Today it may just be a matter of time until one building goes the extra mile.</s>
