 <s id="1">When we think of games, there's all kinds of things.</s>
 <s id="2">Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe, you're looking forward to a new game.</s>
 <s id="3">You've been up too late playing a game.</s>
 <s id="4">All these things happen to me.</s>
 <s id="5">But when we think about games, a lot of times we think about stuff like this: first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games, or maybe you're a Facebook game player.</s>
 <s id="6">This is one my partner and I worked on.</s>
 <s id="7">Maybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.</s>
 <s id="8">This is a lighter form of game.</s>
 <s id="9">Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.</s>
 <s id="10">This would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out.</s>
 <s id="11">Or maybe you're in your living room, playing with the Wii with the kids, and there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.</s>
 <s id="12">I make my living from games, I've been lucky enough to do this since I was 15, which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job.</s>
 <s id="13">But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable, but let's just think about this.</s>
 <s id="14">So this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.</s>
 <s id="15">Now I don't know where you guys were, but I was in my living room.</s>
 <s id="16">It was practically a religious event.</s>
 <s id="17">And this is when the Americans beat the Russians, and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.</s>
 <s id="18">Hockey is a game.</s>
 <s id="19">But really, was this a game?</s>
 <s id="20">I mean, people cried.</s>
 <s id="21">I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) And so this was an amazing experience.</s>
 <s id="23">Or, if anybody here is from Boston -- So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series after I believe, 351 years -- (Laughter) when they won the World Series, it was amazing.</s>
 <s id="24">I happened to be living in Springfield at the time, and the best part of it was, you would close the women's door in the bathroom, and I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?</s>
 <s id="25">Or the houses, you'd come out, because every game, well, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?</s>
 <s id="26">So we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on in the whole block.</s>
 <s id="27">And kids -- the attendance was down in school, kids weren't going to school, but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?</s>
 <s id="28">I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox, and we know where they're stacked.</s>
 <s id="29">So this was an amazing experience, and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles, people didn't say, "You know, really, I can die now, because the Red Sox won."</s>
 <s id="30">And many people did.</s>
 <s id="31">So games, it means something more to us.</s>
 <s id="32">It absolutely means something more.</s>
 <s id="33">So now, this is an abrupt transition here.</s>
 <s id="34">There was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.</s>
 <s id="35">I was the head of a college department teaching games, so, again, it was sort of a real job, and now I got to talk about making them as opposed to making them.</s>
 <s id="36">Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department, is to eat, and I did that very well -- and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson.</s>
 <s id="37">So this is Zig in this photograph, this is also one of Zig's photographs.</s>
 <s id="38">He's a photographer.</s>
 <s id="39">And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself, and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation.</s>
 <s id="40">And this particular shot -- this is one of the more traditional shots.</s>
 <s id="41">This is a rain dancer.</s>
 <s id="42">And this is one of my favorite shots here.</s>
 <s id="43">So you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.</s>
 <s id="44">This is an expression of culture, right?</s>
 <s id="45">And this is actually from his Degradation series.</s>
 <s id="46">And what was most fascinating to me about this series is just, look at that little boy there, can you imagine?</s>
 <s id="47">We can see that's a traditional Native American.</s>
 <s id="48">Now I just want to change that guy's race.</s>
 <s id="49">Just imagine if that's a black guy.</s>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">So, "Honey, come here, let's get you a picture with the black guy."</s>
  <s id="50.2">Right?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">Like, seriously, nobody would do this.</s>
 <s id="52">It baffles the mind.</s>
 <s id="53">And so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind.</s>
 <s id="54">His favorite photograph -- my favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here -- is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.</s>
 <s id="55">(Laughter) So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer, and he was talking with another photographer about a shooting that had occurred, and it was on an Indian Reservation.</s>
 <s id="56">He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it, but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it.</s>
 <s id="57">He just couldn't capture the picture.</s>
 <s id="58">And so they were talking back and forth about this question.</s>
 <s id="59">Do you take the picture or not?</s>
 <s id="60">And that was fascinating to me as a game designer, because it never occurs to me, should I make the game about this difficult topic or not?</s>
 <s id="61">Because we just make things that are fun or will make you feel fear, that visceral excitement.</s>
 <s id="62">But every other medium does it.</s>
 <s id="63">So this is my kid.</s>
 <s id="64">This is Maezza, and when she was seven years old, she came home from school one day, and like I do every single day, I asked her, "What did you do today?"</s>
 <s id="65">So she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">Now, this was a big moment.</s>
  <s id="66.2">Maezza's dad is black, and I knew this day was coming.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="67">I wasn't expecting it at seven, I don't know why, but I wasn't.</s>
 <s id="68">Anyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"</s>
 <s id="69">So she proceeded to tell me, and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.</s>
 <s id="70">"The ships start in England, they come down from England, they go to Africa, they go across the ocean -- that's the Middle Passage part -- they come to America, where the slaves are sold," she's telling me.</s>
 <s id="71">But Abraham Lincoln was elected president, and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation, and now they're free.</s>
 <s id="72">Pause for about 10 seconds.</s>
 <s id="73">"Can I play a game, Mommy?"</s>
 <p id="p74">
  <s id="74.1">And I thought, that's it?</s>
  <s id="74.2">And so, you know, this is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event, and she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise, this is more or less how it sounds to her.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="75">(Laughter) And so, to me, I wanted more value in this, so when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."</s>
 <s id="76">(Laughter) And so I happened to have all of these little pieces.</s>
 <s id="77">I'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.</s>
 <s id="78">I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these, and I tell her to paint them in different families.</s>
 <s id="79">These are pictures of Maezza when she was -- God, it still chokes me up seeing these.</s>
 <s id="80">So she's painting her little families.</s>
 <s id="81">So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.</s>
 <s id="82">This was the boat, it was made quickly, obviously.</s>
 <s id="83">And so the basic gist of it is, I grabbed a bunch of families, and she's like, "Mommy, but you forgot the pink baby and you forgot the blue daddy and you forgot all these other things."</s>
 <s id="84">And she says, "They want to go."</s>
 <s id="85">And I said, "Honey, no, they don't want to go.</s>
 <s id="86">This is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."</s>
 <s id="87">So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother, and as we're going across the ocean, following these rules, she realizes that she's rolling pretty high, and she says to me, "We're not going to make it."</s>
 <s id="88">And she realizes, we don't have enough food, and so she asks what to do, and I say -- remember, she's seven -- "We can either put some people in the water or we can hope that they don't get sick and we make it to the other side."</s>
 <s id="89">Just the look on her face came over -- now mind you this is after a month of -- this is Black History Month, right?</s>
 <s id="90">After a month, she says to me, "Did this really happen?"</s>
 <p id="p91">
  <s id="91.1">And I said, "Yes."</s>
  <s id="91.2">And so she said -- this is her brother and sister -- "If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="92">"Yes."</s>
 <s id="93">"But I'd get to see them in America."</s>
 <s id="94">"No."</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">"But what if I saw them?</s>
  <s id="95.2">Couldn't we stay together?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="96">"So Daddy could be gone."</s>
 <s id="97">"Yes."</s>
 <s id="98">She was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, I started to cry, her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.</s>
 <s id="99">He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.</s>
 <s id="100">And so, we made this game, and she got it.</s>
 <s id="101">She got it because she spent time with these people.</s>
 <s id="102">It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.</s>
 <s id="103">And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.</s>
 <s id="104">This is the game, which I've ended up calling "The New World," because I like the phrase.</s>
 <s id="105">I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships.</s>
 <s id="106">But when this happened, I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.</s>
 <s id="107">I'd been making games for 20-some years, and then I decided to do it again.</s>
 <s id="108">My history is Irish.</s>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">So this is a game called "Síochán Leat."</s>
  <s id="109.2">It's "peace be with you."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">It's the entire history of my family in a single game.</s>
 <s id="111">I made another game called "Train."</s>
 <s id="112">I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics, and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover, and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own.</s>
 <s id="113">And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.</s>
 <s id="114">This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.</s>
 <s id="115">I was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.</s>
 <s id="116">It's the same thing.</s>
 <s id="117">I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.</s>
 <s id="118">And the one I'm working on right now, which is -- because I'm right in the middle of it, and these for some reason choke me up like crazy -- is a game called "Mexican Kitchen Workers."</s>
 <s id="119">And originally, it was a math problem, more or less.</s>
 <s id="120">Here's the economics of illegal immigration.</s>
 <s id="121">And the more I learned about Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, and it is obviously with Mexicans, too, but it's much more than that.</s>
 <p id="p122">
  <s id="122.1">It's an expression of love.</s>
  <s id="122.2">It's an expression of -- God, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="123">I'll look away from the picture.</s>
 <s id="124">It's an expression of beauty, it's how they say they love you.</s>
 <s id="125">It's how they say they care, and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother without saying "food" in the first sentence.</s>
 <s id="126">And so to me, this beautiful culture, this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games.</s>
 <s id="127">And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics, it changes our perceptions about those people in topics, and it changes ourselves.</s>
 <s id="128">We change as people through games, because we're involved, and we're playing, and we're learning as we do so.</s>
 <s id="129">Thank you.</s>
