 <s id="1">Autism is something that many people know about.</s>
 <s id="2">For example, some people think that autistic people are fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on about the same topic.</s>
 <s id="3">Some people think that autistic people do not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing at the wrong time.</s>
 <s id="4">Some people think that autistic people are socially awkward and lack humor and empathy.</s>
 <s id="5">Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have the right impression of autism.</s>
 <s id="6">How do I know?</s>
 <s id="7">Because I have autism.</s>
 <s id="8">I do have my own obsessions with things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me.</s>
 <s id="9">Each of us are different and unique in our own way.</s>
 <s id="10">However, there is not a lot of information out there on what an autistic life actually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes.</s>
 <s id="11">And we see these often in the media.</s>
 <s id="12">Some of the more common stereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius.</s>
 <s id="13">And the lack of knowledge on autism doesn't stop there either.</s>
 <s id="14">Did you know that some people are trying to find a cure for autism?</s>
 <s id="15">That's because they see it as a negative thing, as a disease.</s>
 <s id="16">Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism is not a disease.</s>
 <s id="17">It's just another way of thinking and looking at the world.</s>
 <s id="18">Our brains function differently from most people's brains.</s>
 <s id="19">Think of it like comparing and Xbox and a PlayStation.</s>
 <s id="20">They're both highly capable consoles with different programming.</s>
 <s id="21">But if you put your Xbox game in a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation communicates differently.</s>
 <s id="22">When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently.</s>
 <s id="23">Oh, and I also see nice hair.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) (Applause) But the question is, am I really diseased if I just think differently?</s>
 <s id="25">The main problem with living autistic in today's society is that the world just isn't built for us.</s>
 <s id="26">There's so many ways that we can get overwhelmed.</s>
 <s id="27">For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed all the time is loud noises, which means I never crank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan of large parties.</s>
 <s id="28">But other people on the spectrum might get overwhelmed with things like bright lights or strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential to create anxiety.</s>
 <s id="29">Think about all of the social gatherings you've been to in the past.</s>
 <s id="30">Was there loud music playing?</s>
 <s id="31">Were there really bright lights?</s>
 <s id="32">Were there lots of different food smells going on at the same time?</s>
 <s id="33">Were there lots of conversations happening all at once?</s>
 <s id="34">Those things may not have bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming.</s>
 <s id="35">So in those situations, we do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive motion or a noise or some other random fidgeting that may or may not seem normal.</s>
 <s id="36">Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin.</s>
 <s id="37">Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out.</s>
 <s id="38">It can often feel necessary for us to stim.</s>
 <s id="39">However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it.</s>
 <s id="40">When we're forced to hide our autistic traits like this, it's called masking.</s>
 <s id="41">And some people mask better than others.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">I mask so well sometimes that people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal.</s>
  <s id="42.2">(Laughs) But at the end of the day, it gets really stressful.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">Even something like doing my homework at night becomes very tiring.</s>
 <s id="44">Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism.</s>
 <s id="45">However, all it really does is makes us ashamed of showing our true selves.</s>
 <s id="46">Another common stereotype that is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy.</s>
 <s id="47">And again, this is not true.</s>
 <s id="48">I actually have lots of empathy.</s>
 <s id="49">I'm just not really good at showing it.</s>
 <s id="50">Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles that they're going through, I often don't know how to express my reply.</s>
 <s id="51">And that is why I don't show as much empathy as my nonautistic friends do.</s>
 <s id="52">Emotional expression, however much or however little, is difficult for me.</s>
 <s id="53">And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion one feels at all times.</s>
 <s id="54">Though of course, I cannot express it that way.</s>
 <s id="55">Otherwise, let's say, happiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst of gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal "woohoos."</s>
 <s id="56">(Laughter) Whereas you may just smile.</s>
 <s id="57">(Laughter) Whether it be receiving an awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic story on the news, I cannot really express my reply without bursting, so once again, I have to mask it in order to appear normal.</s>
 <s id="58">My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me express extremes or nothing.</s>
 <s id="59">So my ...</s>
 <s id="60">I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.</s>
 <s id="61">This diagnosis helps me and my friends and family to know how my mind works.</s>
 <s id="62">And in the world, approximately one percent of the population is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.</s>
 <s id="63">And this number is growing.</s>
 <s id="64">However, we are still a big minority.</s>
 <s id="65">And there's still lots of people that do not see us as equals to other people.</s>
 <s id="66">This is my family.</s>
 <s id="67">And in my family, there is one other person who is also autistic.</s>
 <s id="68">My mother.</s>
 <s id="69">Yes, adult women can also be autistic.</s>
 <s id="70">My dad and my brother are both nonautistic.</s>
 <s id="71">Sometimes it can be a bit difficult for us to communicate with each other, however.</s>
 <s id="72">Sometimes I'll say something like, "Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?"</s>
 <s id="73">thinking that I can help them to remember certain aspects of it.</s>
 <s id="74">When they get confused, I often have to elaborate myself on that.</s>
 <s id="75">And we often have to say things in a number of different ways so that everyone understands.</s>
 <s id="76">However, despite all that, we all love each other and respect each other as equals.</s>
 <s id="77">In his book "NeuroTribes," author Steve Silberman states that autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects.</s>
 <s id="78">And this is something that I agree to completely.</s>
 <s id="79">If autism was seen as part of a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed to work better for autistic people.</s>
 <s id="80">I am not ashamed of my autism.</s>
 <s id="81">And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human and I am not diseased.</s>
 <s id="82">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="83">(Applause)</s>
