 <s id="1">Most of the forest lives in the shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy.</s>
 <s id="2">These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and thousands of grandchildren.</s>
 <s id="3">They check in with their neighbors, sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives.</s>
 <s id="4">They do all this rooted in place, unable to speak, reach out, or move around.</s>
 <s id="5">The secret to their success lies under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the towering trunks above.</s>
 <s id="6">Partnering with these roots are symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae.</s>
 <s id="7">These fungi have countless branching, thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium.</s>
 <s id="8">The mycelium spreads across a much larger area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different trees together.</s>
 <s id="9">These connections form mycorrhizal networks.</s>
 <s id="10">Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules between trees.</s>
 <s id="11">We know the oldest trees have the largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly complicated to trace.</s>
 <s id="12">That’s because there are about a hundred species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique set of fungal associations.</s>
 <s id="13">To get a sense of how substances flow through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a neighboring seedling.</s>
 <s id="14">Sugar’s journey starts high above the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees above the canopy.</s>
 <s id="15">The leaves use the ample sunlight up there to create sugars through photosynthesis.</s>
 <s id="16">This essential fuel then travels through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap.</s>
 <s id="17">From there, sugar flows down to the roots.</s>
 <s id="18">Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi.</s>
 <s id="19">Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they need them for fuel just like trees do.</s>
 <s id="20">They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into the tree roots.</s>
 <s id="21">In general, substances flow from where they are more abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink.</s>
 <s id="22">That means that the sugars flow from the tree roots into the fungal hyphae.</s>
 <s id="23">Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through pores between cells or through special hollow transporter hyphae.</s>
 <s id="24">The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars.</s>
 <s id="25">But why does fungus transport resources from tree to tree?</s>
 <s id="26">This is one of the mysteries of the mycorrhizal networks.</s>
 <s id="27">It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit.</s>
 <s id="28">The fungus likely benefits in less obvious ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways aren’t totally clear.</s>
 <s id="29">Maybe the fungus benefits from having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling molecules between trees.</s>
 <s id="30">Or maybe plants reduce their contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges between trees.</s>
 <s id="31">Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount of information between trees.</s>
 <s id="32">Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their own species or not.</s>
 <s id="33">They can even tell when information is coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent.</s>
 <s id="34">Trees can also share information about events like drought or insect attacks through their fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats.</s>
 <s id="35">The forest’s health relies on these intricate communications and exchanges.</s>
 <s id="36">With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound to impact others.</s>
