 <s id="1">It's great being here at TED.</s>
 <s id="2">You know, I think there might be some presentations that will go over my head, but the most amazing concepts are the ones that go right under my feet.</s>
 <s id="3">The little things in life, sometimes that we forget about, like pollination, that we take for granted.</s>
 <s id="4">And you can't tell the story about pollinators -- bees, bats, hummingbirds, butterflies -- without telling the story about the invention of flowers and how they co-evolved over 50 million years.</s>
 <s id="5">I've been filming time-lapse flowers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 35 years.</s>
 <s id="6">To watch them move is a dance I'm never going to get tired of.</s>
 <s id="7">It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.</s>
 <s id="8">Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with.</s>
 <s id="9">Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth.</s>
 <s id="10">It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it.</s>
 <s id="11">When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action.</s>
 <s id="12">We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.</s>
 <s id="13">And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind.</s>
 <s id="14">It's like the canary in the coalmine.</s>
 <s id="15">If they disappear, so do we.</s>
 <s id="16">It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it.</s>
 <s id="17">What motivated me to film their behavior was something that I asked my scientific advisers: "What motivates the pollinators?"</s>
 <s id="18">Well, their answer was, "It's all about risk and reward."</s>
 <s id="19">Like a wide-eyed kid, I'd say, "Why is that?"</s>
 <s id="20">And they'd say, "Well, because they want to survive."</s>
 <s id="21">I go, "Why?"</s>
 <s id="22">"Well, in order to reproduce."</s>
 <s id="23">"Well, why?"</s>
 <s id="24">And I thought that they'd probably say, "Well, it's all about sex."</s>
 <s id="25">And Chip Taylor, our monarch butterfly expert, he replied, "Nothing lasts forever.</s>
 <s id="26">Everything in the universe wears out."</s>
 <s id="27">And that blew my mind.</s>
 <s id="28">Because I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life.</s>
 <s id="29">Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment.</s>
 <s id="30">It's the mystical moment where life regenerates itself, over and over again.</s>
 <s id="31">So here is some nectar from my film.</s>
 <s id="32">I hope you'll drink, tweet and plant some seeds to pollinate a friendly garden.</s>
 <s id="33">And always take time to smell the flowers, and let it fill you with beauty, and rediscover that sense of wonder.</s>
 <s id="34">Here are some images from the film.</s>
 <s id="35">(Music) (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="36">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="37">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="38">(Applause)</s>
