 <s id="1">You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.</s>
 <s id="2">And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.</s>
 <s id="3">You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.</s>
 <s id="4">I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies.</s>
 <s id="5">And you know, an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.</s>
 <s id="6">You've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany.</s>
 <s id="7">That's a painting of a circle.</s>
 <s id="8">A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.</s>
 <s id="9">It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to tell you about.</s>
 <s id="10">My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.</s>
 <s id="11">I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.</s>
 <s id="12">She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers' lounge.</s>
 <s id="13">She did it in secret.</s>
 <s id="14">She did it for three years.</s>
 <s id="15">And I had to get out of town.</s>
 <s id="16">I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- met a lover -- and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.</s>
 <s id="17">About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.</s>
 <s id="18">I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults.</s>
 <s id="19">Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.</s>
 <s id="20">And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to please be quick about this."</s>
 <s id="21">Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.</s>
 <s id="22">We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried, and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.</s>
 <s id="23">We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary.</s>
 <s id="24">It's something we knew how to do.</s>
 <s id="25">And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.</s>
 <s id="26">And what had happened was the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself.</s>
 <s id="27">The epiphany is that death is a part of life.</s>
 <s id="28">She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.</s>
 <s id="29">And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.</s>
 <s id="30">It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.</s>
 <s id="31">It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out.</s>
 <s id="32">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="33">(Applause)</s>
