 <s id="1">Upon emerging from stasis, Ethic is the unfortunate recipient of three surprises.</s>
 <s id="2">The first: a prison cell.</s>
 <s id="3">The second: complete amnesia.</s>
 <s id="4">And the third: a mysterious stranger has gotten stuck squeezing through the bars on her window.</s>
 <s id="5">His name is Hedge, and he has come to help Ethic save the world.</s>
 <s id="6">But first they have to break out of jail.</s>
 <s id="7">Hedge turns his hand into a lockpick and outlines the challenge ahead.</s>
 <s id="8">Each lock in the prison works in the same unusual way.</s>
 <s id="9">Inside the keyhole is a red dial that can be rotated to one of 100 positions numbered 1 through 100.</s>
 <s id="10">The key for a given cell spins the dial to the right position, which, when stopped there, makes it turn green and unlocks the door.</s>
 <s id="11">It would be out of the question to steal keys from a guard, but Hedge has a better idea.</s>
 <s id="12">Hedge can carry out Ethic‘s commands.</s>
 <s id="13">If Ethic tells him to walk 5 steps forward, turn right, then walk another 5 steps, that’s exactly what he’ll do.</s>
 <s id="14">Hedge needs specific instructions though.</s>
 <s id="15">If Ethic says “pick the lock” or “try every combination” that would be too vague, but “spin the dial 5 positions forward” would work.</s>
 <s id="16">Once out of the cell, they will only have a few moments to crack the lock for the outer prison door too before the guards catch them.</s>
 <s id="17">So what instructions will allow Hedge to efficiently open any door?</s>
 <s id="18">Pause now to figure it out for yourself.</s>
 <s id="19">Before we explain the solution, here’s a hint.</s>
 <s id="20">A key programming concept that can help unlock the door is called a loop.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">This can be one or more instructions that Hedge will iterate— or repeat— a specified number of times, like “jump up and down 100 times.”</s>
  <s id="21.2">Or an instruction that Hedge will repeat until a condition is met, such as “keep jumping up and down until it’s 7 o’clock.”</s>
  <s id="21.3">Pause now to figure it out for yourself.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">The first thing that’s clear is that you need to find a way for Hedge to try every combination until one works.</s>
 <s id="23">What takes a little more effort is how exactly you do so.</s>
 <s id="24">One solution would be to instruct Hedge to try every combination in succession.</s>
 <s id="25">Try 1 and check the light.</s>
 <s id="26">If it turns green, open the door, and if not, try 2.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">If that doesn’t work try 3.</s>
  <s id="27.2">All the way up to 100.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">But it would be tedious to lay that out in its entirety.</s>
 <s id="29">Why write more than 100 lines of code, when you can do the same thing with just 3?</s>
 <s id="30">This is where a loop comes in.</s>
 <s id="31">There are a few ways to go about this.</s>
 <s id="32">The lock has 100 positions, so Ethic could say “Check the dial’s color, then spin the dial forward once, for 100 repetitions.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">Remember where the dial turns green, then have Hedge set it back to that number.”</s>
  <s id="33.2">A loop like this, where you specify the number of times it repeats, is called a “for" loop.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">But an even more efficient loop would have Hedge spin the dial one position at a time until it turns green and as soon as that happens, have him stop and open the door.</s>
 <s id="35">That way if the door unlocks on 1, he doesn’t need to cycle through all the rest of the numbers.</s>
 <s id="36">This is an “until” loop, because it involves doing an action until a condition is met.</s>
 <s id="37">A similar, alternate approach would be to turn the dial while it’s still red, then stop.</s>
 <s id="38">That’s called a “while” loop.</s>
 <s id="39">Back to the adventure.</s>
 <s id="40">Hedge loops through the combinations, and the cell opens at 41.</s>
 <s id="41">Ethic and Hedge wait until the perfect moment in the guards’ rotation and make a break for it.</s>
 <s id="42">Soon, Ethic faces a choice: hide inside a mysterious crystal, or try to crack the outer door and make a run for it.</s>
 <s id="43">Ethic chooses to run.</s>
 <s id="44">The second door takes Hedge longer, requiring him to spin all the way to 93.</s>
 <s id="45">But he gets it open and takes the opportunity to explain why he’s rescued Ethic.</s>
 <s id="46">The world is in turmoil: robots have taken over, and only Ethic can set things right.</s>
 <s id="47">In order to do so, they’ll need to collect three powerful artifacts that are being used for nefarious purposes across the land.</s>
 <s id="48">Only then can Ethic return to the world machine— that giant crystal— to set things right.</s>
 <s id="49">Ethic may have escaped the prison… but what has she gotten herself into?</s>
