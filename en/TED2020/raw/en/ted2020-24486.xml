 <s id="1">A lone priestess walks towards an underground chamber.</s>
 <s id="2">People line the streets to watch as she proclaims her innocence.</s>
 <s id="3">It doesn't matter.</s>
 <s id="4">She's already been judged and found guilty.</s>
 <s id="5">The sentence?</s>
 <s id="6">Live burial.</s>
 <s id="7">The underground chamber contains a portion of bread, water, milk, and oil.</s>
 <s id="8">She will have a lamp, a bed, and a blanket, but she won't emerge alive.</s>
 <s id="9">At the threshold, the priestess pauses, claims her innocence one last time, then enters the chamber never to be seen again by the Roman people.</s>
 <s id="10">The priestess is one of Rome's six Vestal Virgins, each carefully selected as children from Rome's most aristocratic families.</s>
 <s id="11">But now with her death, there are only five, and a new priestess must be chosen.</s>
 <s id="12">The six-year-old Licinia witnessed the spectacle, never suspecting that a few days later, she'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin.</s>
 <s id="13">Her age, her patrician family lineage, and her apparent good health makes her the best candidate to serve the goddess Vesta in the eyes of the Romans.</s>
 <s id="14">Her parents are proud that their daughter's been chosen.</s>
 <s id="15">Licinia is afraid, but she has no choice in the matter.</s>
 <s id="16">She must serve the goddess for at least the next 30 years.</s>
 <s id="17">For the first ten years of Licinia's service, she's considered in training, learning how to be a Vestal Virgin.</s>
 <s id="18">Her most important duty is keeping vigil over the flame of Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth.</s>
 <s id="19">Vesta doesn't have a statue like other Roman gods and goddesses.</s>
 <s id="20">Instead, she's represented by the flame which burns day and night in her temple located next to the Forum in the center of the city.</s>
 <s id="21">Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia spends part of each day on shift, watching and tending to the flame.</s>
 <s id="22">The flame represents two things.</s>
 <s id="23">The first is the continuation of Rome as a power in the world.</s>
 <s id="24">The Romans believed that if the flame goes out, the city's in danger.</s>
 <s id="25">The flame also symbolizes the continuing virginity of Vesta's priestesses.</s>
 <s id="26">For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity signaled not only her castitas, or modest spirit and body, but also her ritual purity.</s>
 <s id="27">So Licinia knows she must never let the flame go out.</s>
 <s id="28">Her life, the lives of her fellow Vestals, and the safety of Rome itself depends upon it.</s>
 <s id="29">Licinia learns to collect water each day from a nearby fountain to cleanse the temple.</s>
 <s id="30">She learns the Fasti, the calendar of sacred rituals and she watches while the senior priestesses conduct sacrifices.</s>
 <s id="31">By the time Licinia completes her training, she's 16 years old.</s>
 <s id="32">Licinia understands that the way she must act is a reflection of the goddess she serves.</s>
 <s id="33">When it's her turn to collect the water, she keeps her eyes lowered to the ground.</s>
 <s id="34">When she performs sacrifices, she focuses intently on the task.</s>
 <s id="35">Licinia directs her energy towards being the best priestess she can be.</s>
 <s id="36">She's worried that someday the state will claim her life for its own purposes to protect itself from danger.</s>
 <s id="37">Licinia could be accused of incestum, meaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed whether she's innocent or guilty.</s>
 <s id="38">Licinia fully understands now why her predecessor was buried alive.</s>
 <s id="39">Ten years ago, the flame of Vesta went out.</s>
 <s id="40">The priestesses knew that they couldn't keep it a secret.</s>
 <s id="41">The future of Rome depended upon it.</s>
 <s id="42">They went to the chief priest and he opened an investigation to discover why the flame had failed.</s>
 <s id="43">Someone came forward and claimed that one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin.</s>
 <s id="44">That was the beginning of the end.</s>
 <s id="45">The accused protested her innocence, but it wasn't enough.</s>
 <s id="46">She was tried and found guilty.</s>
 <s id="47">That Vestal's death was meant to protect the city, but Licinia weeps for what has been lost and for what she knows now.</s>
 <s id="48">Her own path was paved by the death of another, and her life could be taken just as easily for something as simple as a flame going out.</s>
