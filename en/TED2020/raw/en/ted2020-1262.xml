 <s id="1">So magic is a very introverted field.</s>
 <s id="2">While scientists regularly publish their latest research, we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets.</s>
 <s id="3">That's true even amongst peers.</s>
 <s id="4">But if you look at creative practice as a form of research, or art as a form of R&amp;amp;D for humanity, then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research?</s>
 <s id="5">Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic.</s>
 <s id="6">And about three years ago, I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster.</s>
 <s id="7">Today, I'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations.</s>
 <s id="8">It's an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system, or a digital storytelling tool.</s>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">Could we bring down the lights please?</s>
  <s id="9.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">So let's give this a try.</s>
 <s id="11">And I'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">(Applause) (Music) Terribly sorry.</s>
  <s id="12.2">I forgot the floor.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">Wake up.</s>
 <s id="14">Hey.</s>
 <s id="15">Come on.</s>
 <s id="16">(Music) Please.</s>
 <s id="17">(Music) Come on.</s>
 <s id="18">Ah, sorry about that.</s>
 <s id="19">Forgot this.</s>
 <s id="20">(Music) Give it another try.</s>
 <s id="21">Okay.</s>
 <s id="22">He figured out the system.</s>
 <s id="23">(Music) (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Uh oh.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">(Music) All right.</s>
  <s id="24.2">Let's try this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">Come on.</s>
 <s id="26">(Music) (Laughter) (Music) Hey.</s>
 <s id="27">(Music) You heard her, go ahead.</s>
 <s id="28">(Laughter) (Applause) Bye-bye.</s>
 <s id="29">(Applause)</s>
