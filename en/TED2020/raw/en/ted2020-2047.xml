 <s id="1">I was born in Taiwan.</s>
 <s id="2">I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, and I like going to night markets.</s>
 <s id="3">I love the energy of the night markets, the colors, the lights, the toys, and all the unexpected things I find every time I go, things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks.</s>
 <s id="4">When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart, any kind of toys I'd find around the house, like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.</s>
 <s id="5">I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play.</s>
 <s id="6">In these early installations, I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags, and things I would find in the hardware store or around the house.</s>
 <s id="7">I would take things like highlighter pen, mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy.</s>
 <s id="8">I like these materials because of the way they look, the way they feel, and they're very affordable.</s>
 <s id="9">I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.</s>
 <s id="10">I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button, get a different perspective, and see what it does.</s>
 <s id="11">(Laughter) I also like to modify household appliances.</s>
 <s id="12">This is an automatic night light.</s>
 <s id="13">Some of you might have them at home.</s>
 <s id="14">I would cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use modeling clay, stick it onto the television, and then I would videotape my eye, and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, so you turn on the lightbulb.</s>
 <s id="15">The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime, and it will shut off the light.</s>
 <s id="16">I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, so I built this device using bicycle helmets, some lightbulbs and television sets.</s>
 <s id="17">It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes.</s>
 <s id="18">This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, so I have a diversity of eyes to use for my other sculptures.</s>
 <s id="19">This sculpture has four eyes.</s>
 <s id="20">Each eye is controlling a different device.</s>
 <s id="21">This eye is turning itself around in a television.</s>
 <s id="22">This eye is inflating a plastic tube.</s>
 <s id="23">This eye is watching a video of another piece being made.</s>
 <s id="24">And these two eyes are activating glowing water.</s>
 <s id="25">Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions around the world.</s>
 <s id="26">I love science and biology.</s>
 <s id="27">In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">I love these creatures.</s>
  <s id="28.2">I love the way they look, the way they feel.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">They're soft, they're slimy, and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment, either to attract mates, for self-defense, or to attract food.</s>
 <s id="30">This research inspired my work in many different ways, things like movement or different light patterns.</s>
 <s id="31">So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out, trying that out, and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.</s>
 <s id="32">I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens.</s>
 <s id="33">This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures, some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.</s>
 <s id="34">From afar, they look alien-like, but when you look closer, they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers.</s>
 <s id="35">I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous.</s>
 <s id="36">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
