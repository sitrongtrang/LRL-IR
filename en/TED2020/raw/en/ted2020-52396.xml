 <s id="1">Many of us here use technology in our day-to-day.</s>
 <s id="2">And some of us rely on technology to do our jobs.</s>
 <s id="3">For a while, I thought of machines and the technologies that drive them as perfect tools that could make my work more efficient and more productive.</s>
 <s id="4">But with the rise of automation across so many different industries, it led me to wonder: If machines are starting to be able to do the work traditionally done by humans, what will become of the human hand?</s>
 <s id="5">How does our desire for perfection, precision and automation affect our ability to be creative?</s>
 <s id="6">In my work as an artist and researcher, I explore AI and robotics to develop new processes for human creativity.</s>
 <s id="7">For the past few years, I've made work alongside machines, data and emerging technologies.</s>
 <s id="8">It's part of a lifelong fascination about the dynamics of individuals and systems and all the messiness that that entails.</s>
 <s id="9">It's how I'm exploring questions about where AI ends and we begin and where I'm developing processes that investigate potential sensory mixes of the future.</s>
 <s id="10">I think it's where philosophy and technology intersect.</s>
 <s id="11">Doing this work has taught me a few things.</s>
 <s id="12">It's taught me how embracing imperfection can actually teach us something about ourselves.</s>
 <s id="13">It's taught me that exploring art can actually help shape the technology that shapes us.</s>
 <s id="14">And it's taught me that combining AI and robotics with traditional forms of creativity -- visual arts in my case -- can help us think a little bit more deeply about what is human and what is the machine.</s>
 <s id="15">And it's led me to the realization that collaboration is the key to creating the space for both as we move forward.</s>
 <s id="16">It all started with a simple experiment with machines, called "Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1."</s>
 <s id="17">I call the machine "D.O.U.G." for short.</s>
 <s id="18">Before I built D.O.U.G, I didn't know anything about building robots.</s>
 <s id="19">I took some open-source robotic arm designs, I hacked together a system where the robot would match my gestures and follow [them] in real time.</s>
 <s id="20">The premise was simple: I would lead, and it would follow.</s>
 <s id="21">I would draw a line, and it would mimic my line.</s>
 <s id="22">So back in 2015, there we were, drawing for the first time, in front of a small audience in New York City.</s>
 <s id="23">The process was pretty sparse -- no lights, no sounds, nothing to hide behind.</s>
 <s id="24">Just my palms sweating and the robot's new servos heating up.</s>
 <s id="25">(Laughs) Clearly, we were not built for this.</s>
 <s id="26">But something interesting happened, something I didn't anticipate.</s>
 <s id="27">See, D.O.U.G., in its primitive form, wasn't tracking my line perfectly.</s>
 <s id="28">While in the simulation that happened onscreen it was pixel-perfect, in physical reality, it was a different story.</s>
 <s id="29">It would slip and slide and punctuate and falter, and I would be forced to respond.</s>
 <s id="30">There was nothing pristine about it.</s>
 <s id="31">And yet, somehow, the mistakes made the work more interesting.</s>
 <s id="32">The machine was interpreting my line but not perfectly.</s>
 <s id="33">And I was forced to respond.</s>
 <s id="34">We were adapting to each other in real time.</s>
 <s id="35">And seeing this taught me a few things.</s>
 <s id="36">It showed me that our mistakes actually made the work more interesting.</s>
 <s id="37">And I realized that, you know, through the imperfection of the machine, our imperfections became what was beautiful about the interaction.</s>
 <s id="38">And I was excited, because it led me to the realization that maybe part of the beauty of human and machine systems is their shared inherent fallibility.</s>
 <s id="39">For the second generation of D.O.U.G., I knew I wanted to explore this idea.</s>
 <s id="40">But instead of an accident produced by pushing a robotic arm to its limits, I wanted to design a system that would respond to my drawings in ways that I didn't expect.</s>
 <s id="41">So, I used a visual algorithm to extract visual information from decades of my digital and analog drawings.</s>
 <s id="42">I trained a neural net on these drawings in order to generate recurring patterns in the work that were then fed through custom software back into the machine.</s>
 <s id="43">I painstakingly collected as many of my drawings as I could find -- finished works, unfinished experiments and random sketches -- and tagged them for the AI system.</s>
 <s id="44">And since I'm an artist, I've been making work for over 20 years.</s>
 <s id="45">Collecting that many drawings took months, it was a whole thing.</s>
 <s id="46">And here's the thing about training AI systems: it's actually a lot of hard work.</s>
 <s id="47">A lot of work goes on behind the scenes.</s>
 <s id="48">But in doing the work, I realized a little bit more about how the architecture of an AI is constructed.</s>
 <s id="49">And I realized it's not just made of models and classifiers for the neural network.</s>
 <s id="50">But it's a fundamentally malleable and shapable system, one in which the human hand is always present.</s>
 <s id="51">It's far from the omnipotent AI we've been told to believe in.</s>
 <s id="52">So I collected these drawings for the neural net.</s>
 <s id="53">And we realized something that wasn't previously possible.</s>
 <s id="54">My robot D.O.U.G. became a real-time interactive reflection of the work I'd done through the course of my life.</s>
 <s id="55">The data was personal, but the results were powerful.</s>
 <s id="56">And I got really excited, because I started thinking maybe machines don't need to be just tools, but they can function as nonhuman collaborators.</s>
 <s id="57">And even more than that, I thought maybe the future of human creativity isn't in what it makes but how it comes together to explore new ways of making.</s>
 <s id="58">So if D.O.U.G._1 was the muscle, and D.O.U.G._2 was the brain, then I like to think of D.O.U.G._3 as the family.</s>
 <s id="59">I knew I wanted to explore this idea of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale.</s>
 <s id="60">So over the past few months, I worked with my team to develop 20 custom robots that could work with me as a collective.</s>
 <s id="61">They would work as a group, and together, we would collaborate with all of New York City.</s>
 <s id="62">I was really inspired by Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li, who said, "if we want to teach machines how to think, we need to first teach them how to see."</s>
 <s id="63">It made me think of the past decade of my life in New York, and how I'd been all watched over by these surveillance cameras around the city.</s>
 <s id="64">And I thought it would be really interesting if I could use them to teach my robots to see.</s>
 <s id="65">So with this project, I thought about the gaze of the machine, and I began to think about vision as multidimensional, as views from somewhere.</s>
 <s id="66">We collected video from publicly available camera feeds on the internet of people walking on the sidewalks, cars and taxis on the road, all kinds of urban movement.</s>
 <s id="67">We trained a vision algorithm on those feeds based on a technique called "optical flow," to analyze the collective density, direction, dwell and velocity states of urban movement.</s>
 <s id="68">Our system extracted those states from the feeds as positional data and became pads for my robotic units to draw on.</s>
 <s id="69">Instead of a collaboration of one-to-one, we made a collaboration of many-to-many.</s>
 <s id="70">By combining the vision of human and machine in the city, we reimagined what a landscape painting could be.</s>
 <s id="71">Throughout all of my experiments with D.O.U.G., no two performances have ever been the same.</s>
 <s id="72">And through collaboration, we create something that neither of us could have done alone: we explore the boundaries of our creativity, human and nonhuman working in parallel.</s>
 <s id="73">I think this is just the beginning.</s>
 <s id="74">This year, I've launched Scilicet, my new lab exploring human and interhuman collaboration.</s>
 <s id="75">We're really interested in the feedback loop between individual, artificial and ecological systems.</s>
 <s id="76">We're connecting human and machine output to biometrics and other kinds of environmental data.</s>
 <s id="77">We're inviting anyone who's interested in the future of work, systems and interhuman collaboration to explore with us.</s>
 <s id="78">We know it's not just technologists that have to do this work and that we all have a role to play.</s>
 <s id="79">We believe that by teaching machines how to do the work traditionally done by humans, we can explore and evolve our criteria of what's made possible by the human hand.</s>
 <s id="80">And part of that journey is embracing the imperfections and recognizing the fallibility of both human and machine, in order to expand the potential of both.</s>
 <s id="81">Today, I'm still in pursuit of finding the beauty in human and nonhuman creativity.</s>
 <s id="82">In the future, I have no idea what that will look like, but I'm pretty curious to find out.</s>
 <s id="83">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="84">(Applause)</s>
