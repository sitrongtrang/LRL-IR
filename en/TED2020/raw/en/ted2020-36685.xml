 <s id="1">In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing opportunity to earn full time income for part time work.</s>
 <s id="2">Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience or education.</s>
 <s id="3">There were only two steps to start get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit of their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members to do the same.</s>
 <s id="4">Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members per month at its peak.</s>
 <s id="5">There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million of annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants earned less than they paid in.</s>
 <s id="6">Vemma was eventually charged with operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in.</s>
 <s id="7">Typically, the founder solicits an initial group of people to buy in and promote the scheme.</s>
 <s id="8">They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money those people invest, while the founder also takes a share.</s>
 <s id="9">The pattern repeats for each group of new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled to those who recruited them.</s>
 <s id="10">This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to pay existing members, who think the payments come from a legitimate investment.</s>
 <s id="11">As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new recruits to make money.</s>
 <s id="12">That’s because the number of participants expands exponentially.</s>
 <s id="13">Take a structure where each person has to recruit six more to earn a profit.</s>
 <s id="14">The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more.</s>
 <s id="15">There are 36 people in that second round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits.</s>
 <s id="16">By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members would have to recruit over 13 billion more people total to make money– more than the entire world population.</s>
 <s id="17">In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in.</s>
 <s id="18">And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too.</s>
 <s id="19">Pyramid schemes are illegal in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect.</s>
 <s id="20">They are presented as many different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level marketing businesses.</s>
 <s id="21">The distinction between pyramid schemes and legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy.</s>
 <s id="22">In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling a particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate members for recruitment of new sellers.</s>
 <s id="23">In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make it all but impossible for members to profit purely through sales.</s>
 <s id="24">And many pyramid schemes, like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the pay-and-recruit structure.</s>
 <s id="25">Many pyramid schemes also capitalize on already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, or other tightly knit groups.</s>
 <s id="26">The first few members are encouraged to report a good experience before they actually start making a profit.</s>
 <s id="27">Others in their network follow their example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members aren’t actually profiting.</s>
 <s id="28">Often, the victims are embarrassed into silence.</s>
 <s id="29">Pyramid schemes entice people with the promise of opportunity and empowerment.</s>
 <s id="30">So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves rather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough to earn the returns promised.</s>
 <s id="31">Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time.</s>
 <s id="32">In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or miss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”</s>
  <s id="33.2">Promises of large, life-altering amounts of income are also suspect.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">And finally, a legitimate multi-level marketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the opportunity to sell a product or service.</s>
 <s id="35">Pyramid schemes can be incredibly destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries.</s>
 <s id="36">But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three people you know, and encouraging them to do the same.</s>
