 <s id="1">Feathers are some of the most remarkable things ever made by an animal.</s>
 <s id="2">They are gorgeous in their complexity, delicate in their construction, and yet strong enough to hold a bird thousands of feet in the air.</s>
 <s id="3">Like all things in nature, feathers evolved over millions of years into their modern form.</s>
 <s id="4">It could be hard to imagine how this could have happened.</s>
 <s id="5">After all, what did the intermediate forms look like?</s>
 <s id="6">What good is half a wing, festooned with half-feathers?</s>
 <s id="7">Thanks to science, we now know that birds are living dinosaurs.</s>
 <s id="8">You can see the kinship in their skeletons.</s>
 <s id="9">Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds found in no other animals, such as wish bones.</s>
 <s id="10">And in the late 1990s, paleontologists started digging up some compelling support for that idea: dinosaurs with bits of feathers still preserved on their bodies.</s>
 <s id="11">Since then, scientists have found dozens of species of dinosaurs with remnants of feathers.</s>
 <s id="12">Some were as small as pigeons, and some were the size of a school bus.</s>
 <s id="13">If you look at how they are related on a family tree, the evolution of feathers doesn't seem quite so impossible.</s>
 <s id="14">The most distant feathered relatives of birds had straight feathers that looked like wires.</s>
 <s id="15">Then these wires split apart, producing simple branches.</s>
 <s id="16">In many dinosaur lineages, these simple feathers evolved into more intricate ones, including some that we see today on birds.</s>
 <s id="17">At the same time, the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs, turning from sparse patches of fuzz into dense plumage, which even extended down to their legs.</s>
 <s id="18">A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules that give feathers color.</s>
 <s id="19">They reveal a beautiful range of colors: glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows, alternating strips of black and white, or splashes of bright red.</s>
 <s id="20">Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads, and others had long, dramatic tail feathers.</s>
 <s id="21">Now, none of these dinosaurs could use their feathers to fly - their arms were too short and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy.</s>
 <s id="22">But, birds don't just use feathers to fly.</s>
 <s id="23">A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly with its forest backdrop.</s>
 <s id="24">An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest to shade its young.</s>
 <s id="25">A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers to attract peahens.</s>
 <s id="26">Feathers could have served these functions for dinosaurs too.</s>
 <s id="27">Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight is still a bit of a mystery.</s>
 <s id="28">But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped its arms as it ran up an incline, its feathers would have provided extra lift to help it run faster.</s>
 <s id="29">This accident of physics might have led to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms, which would let them run faster and even leap short distances through the air.</s>
 <s id="30">Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings.</s>
 <s id="31">Only then, perhaps 50 million years after the first wiry feathers evolved, did feathers lift those dinosaurs into the sky.</s>
