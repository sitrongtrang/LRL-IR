 <s id="1">Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name to say, "I exist."</s>
 <s id="2">Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say, "They exist."</s>
 <s id="3">From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine, the rooftops of Kenya to the favelas of Rio, paper and glue -- as easy as that.</s>
 <s id="4">I asked a question last year: Can art change the world?</s>
 <s id="5">Well let me tell you, in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year, because the Arab Spring is still spreading, the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?</s>
 <s id="6">The Occupy movement found a voice, and I still have to speak English constantly.</s>
 <s id="7">So there has been a lot of change.</s>
 <s id="8">So when I had my TED wish last year, I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.</s>
 <s id="9">You are going to take the photos.</s>
 <s id="10">You're going to send them to me.</s>
 <s id="11">I'm going to print them and send them back to you.</s>
 <s id="12">Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense for you to place your own statement.</s>
 <s id="13">This is Inside Out.</s>
 <s id="14">One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.</s>
 <s id="15">Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.</s>
 <s id="16">And we keep sending more every day.</s>
 <s id="17">This is the size.</s>
 <s id="18">Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.</s>
 <s id="19">This one was from Haiti.</s>
 <s id="20">When I launched my wish last year, hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.</s>
 <s id="21">But I say it has to be under the conditions I've always worked: no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.</s>
 <s id="22">A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock and empower the people on the ground who wanted to change the world.</s>
 <s id="23">These are the people I want to talk about to you today.</s>
 <s id="24">Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia, hundreds of portraits were made.</s>
 <s id="25">And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator [with] their own photos.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">Boom!</s>
  <s id="26.2">This is what happened.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">Slim and his friends went through the country and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere to show the diversity in the country.</s>
 <s id="28">They really make Inside Out their own project.</s>
 <s id="29">Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station, and what you see on the ground are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">Russia.</s>
  <s id="30.2">Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe and stood there with the photos to say, "We have rights."</s>
 <s id="32">They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.</s>
 <s id="33">Karachi, Pakistan.</s>
 <s id="34">Sharmeen is actually here.</s>
 <s id="35">She organized a TEDx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town.</s>
 <s id="36">And I want to thank her today.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">North Dakota.</s>
  <s id="37.2">Standing Rock Nation, in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.</s>
 <s id="39">He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.</s>
 <s id="40">And he's here also today.</s>
 <s id="41">Each time I get a wall in New York, I use his photos to continue spreading the project.</s>
 <s id="42">Juarez: You've heard of the border -- one of the most dangerous borders in the world.</s>
 <s id="43">Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border.</s>
 <s id="44">Do you know what it takes to do this?</s>
 <s id="45">People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.</s>
 <s id="46">It was amazing.</s>
 <s id="47">While in Iran at the same time Abololo -- of course a nickname -- has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government.</s>
 <s id="48">I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.</s>
 <s id="49">There are tons of school projects.</s>
 <s id="50">Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.</s>
 <s id="51">Education is so essential.</s>
 <s id="52">Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them, they paste them on the school.</s>
 <s id="53">Here they even got the help of the firemen.</s>
 <s id="54">There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.</s>
 <s id="55">Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">So we went there with a truck.</s>
  <s id="56.2">This is a photobooth truck.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo, 30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.</s>
 <s id="58">Thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street.</s>
 <s id="59">This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.</s>
 <s id="60">They were all holding their photo as a statement.</s>
 <s id="61">On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.</s>
 <s id="62">It's everywhere.</s>
 <s id="63">Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.</s>
 <s id="64">These projects took thousands of actions in one year, making hundreds of thousands of people participating, creating millions of views.</s>
 <s id="65">This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.</s>
 <s id="66">So back to the question, "Can art change the world?"</s>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">Maybe not in one year.</s>
  <s id="67.2">That's the beginning.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">But maybe we should change the question.</s>
 <s id="69">Can art change people's lives?</s>
 <s id="70">From what I've seen this year, yes.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And you know what?</s>
  <s id="71.2">It's just the beginning.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">Let's turn the world inside out together.</s>
 <s id="73">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="74">(Applause)</s>
