 <s id="1">I love theater.</s>
 <s id="2">I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.</s>
 <s id="3">I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.</s>
 <s id="4">The idea that in that room at that moment, everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion, comes together.</s>
 <s id="5">At that moment, we transcend space and time together.</s>
 <s id="6">Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.</s>
 <s id="7">And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.</s>
 <s id="8">Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.</s>
 <s id="9">I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show, and began developing "Upwake."</s>
 <s id="10">"Upwake" tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.</s>
 <s id="11">I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.</s>
 <s id="12">And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.</s>
 <s id="13">So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.</s>
 <s id="14">If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside.</s>
 <s id="15">Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.</s>
 <s id="16">This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life.</s>
 <s id="17">In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.</s>
 <s id="18">I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.</s>
 <s id="19">Go from one world to another in a second.</s>
 <s id="20">I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas.</s>
 <s id="21">At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.</s>
 <s id="22">Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition, live, on stage.</s>
 <s id="23">So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.</s>
 <s id="24">Let's start with technology.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">(Fuse blowing) All right.</s>
  <s id="25.2">Let's start with theater.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) (Buzzing) (Click, click, bang) (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="27">"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.</s>
 <s id="28">I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which I interact with.</s>
 <s id="29">The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.</s>
 <s id="30">I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.</s>
 <s id="31">There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.</s>
 <s id="32">It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.</s>
 <s id="33">Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later, what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists.</s>
 <s id="34">And here are some excerpts.</s>
 <s id="35">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="36">So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.</s>
 <s id="37">And in Austin, Texas, I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.</s>
 <s id="38">When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this: Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.</s>
 <s id="39">I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.</s>
 <s id="40">But the teachers came to me afterward and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.</s>
 <s id="41">And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another.</s>
 <s id="42">Something happened along the way.</s>
 <s id="43">Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.</s>
 <s id="44">Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.</s>
 <s id="45">Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century, and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.</s>
 <s id="46">It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.</s>
 <s id="47">As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.</s>
 <s id="48">And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.</s>
 <s id="49">It's as though you made something resonate within them.</s>
 <s id="50">It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more.</s>
 <s id="51">Because through your mask, they let theirs go.</s>
 <s id="52">Being human is an art form.</s>
 <s id="53">I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal.</s>
 <s id="54">I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.</s>
 <s id="55">I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.</s>
 <s id="56">I know theater unites us.</s>
 <s id="57">Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow, tell various stories through different mediums.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">Comic books.</s>
  <s id="58.2">Quantum physics video games.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="59">And Zero wants to go to the moon.</s>
 <s id="60">In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">The idea is simple, basic.</s>
  <s id="61.2">It's not original, but it's important, and it's important to participate.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">There is a revolution.</s>
 <s id="63">It's a human and technological revolution.</s>
 <s id="64">It's motion and emotion.</s>
 <s id="65">It's information.</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">It's visual.</s>
  <s id="66.2">It's musical.</s>
  <s id="66.3">It's sensorial.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">It's conceptual.</s>
  <s id="67.2">It's universal.</s>
  <s id="67.3">It's beyond words and numbers.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">It's happening.</s>
 <s id="69">The natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.</s>
 <s id="70">There is a revolution in the way that we think, in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories, our evolution.</s>
 <s id="71">This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.</s>
 <s id="72">Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.</s>
 <s id="73">He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.</s>
 <s id="74">He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most.</s>
 <s id="75">We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.</s>
 <s id="76">In the science of today, we become artists.</s>
 <s id="77">In the art of today, we become scientists.</s>
 <p id="p78">
  <s id="78.1">We design our world.</s>
  <s id="78.2">We invent possibilities.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="79">We teach, touch and move.</s>
 <p id="p80">
  <s id="80.1">It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work.</s>
  <s id="80.2">It's now.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="81">(Ringing) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="82">(Applause)</s>
