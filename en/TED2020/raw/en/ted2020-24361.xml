 <s id="1">The most basic function of bodily fat is self-storage of food reserves.</s>
 <s id="2">In prehistoric times, natural selection favored genotypes that could endure harsh conditions by stocking the most fat.</s>
 <s id="3">With chronic malnutrition being the norm for most of human history, genetics evolved to favor fat storage.</s>
 <s id="4">So when did body fat become problematic?</s>
 <s id="5">The negative impacts of being overweight were not even noted in medical literature until as late as the 18th century.</s>
 <s id="6">Then, technological advances coupled with public health measures resulted in the betterment of the quantity, quality, and variety of food.</s>
 <s id="7">Sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to boom economically.</s>
 <s id="8">Output increased, and with it, leisure time and waistlines.</s>
 <s id="9">By the mid 19th century, being excessively overweight, or obese, was recognized as a cause of ill health, and another century later, declared deadly.</s>
 <s id="10">What is the distinction between being overweight and being obese?</s>
 <s id="11">A calculation called the BMI breaks it down for us.</s>
 <s id="12">For example, if someone weighs 65 kilgorams and is 1.5 meters tall, they have a BMI of about 29.</s>
 <s id="13">Obesity is a condition of excess body fat that occurs when a person's BMI is above 30, just over the overweight range of 25 to 29.9.</s>
 <s id="14">While BMI can be a helpful estimate of healthy weight, actual body fat percentage can only really be determined by also considering information like waist circumference and muscle mass.</s>
 <s id="15">Athletes, for instance, have a naturally higher BMI.</s>
 <s id="16">So how does a person become obese?</s>
 <s id="17">At its most basic, obesity is caused by energy imbalance.</s>
 <s id="18">If the energy input from calories is greater than the energy output from physical activity, the body stores the extra calories as fat.</s>
 <s id="19">In most cases, this imbalance comes from a combination of circumstances and choices.</s>
 <s id="20">Adults should be getting at least 2.5 hours of exercise each week, and children a whole hour per day.</s>
 <s id="21">But globally, one in four adults and eight out of ten adolescents aren't active enough.</s>
 <s id="22">Calorie-dense processed foods and growing portion sizes coupled with pervasive marketing lead to passive overeating.</s>
 <s id="23">And scarce resources, and a lack of access to healthy, affordable foods creates an even greater risk in disadvantaged communities.</s>
 <s id="24">Yet, our genetic makeup also plays a part.</s>
 <s id="25">Studies on families and on separated twins have shown a clear causal hereditary relationship to weight gain.</s>
 <s id="26">Recent studies have also found a link between obesity and variations in the bacteria species that live in our digestive systems.</s>
 <s id="27">No matter the cause, obesity is an escalating global epidemic.</s>
 <s id="28">It substantially raises the probability of diseases, like diabetes, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and cancer.</s>
 <s id="29">It affects virtually all ages, genders, and socioeconomic groups in both developed and developing countries.</s>
 <s id="30">With a 60% rise in child obesity globally over just two decades, the problem is too significant to ignore.</s>
 <s id="31">Once a person is obese, the climb to recovery becomes progressively steeper.</s>
 <s id="32">Hormonal and metabolic changes reduce the body's response to overeating.</s>
 <s id="33">After losing weight, a formerly overweight person burns less calories doing the same exercises as a person who is naturally the same weight, making it much more difficult to shed the excess fat.</s>
 <s id="34">And as people gain weight, damage to signaling pathways makes it increasingly difficult for the brain to measure food intake and fat storage.</s>
 <s id="35">There is, however, some evidence that well-monitored, long-term changes in behavior can lead to improvements in obesity-related health issues.</s>
 <s id="36">And weight loss from sustained lifestyle changes, or invasive treatments like bariatric surgery, can improve insulin resistance and decrease inflammation.</s>
 <s id="37">What was once an advantage for survival is now working against us.</s>
 <s id="38">As the world's population continues to slow down and get bigger, moving and consciously eating our way towards a healthier weight is essential to our overall well-being.</s>
 <s id="39">And with the epidemic affecting every country in the world for different socioeconomic reasons, obesity cannot be seen as an isolated issue.</s>
 <s id="40">More global measures for prevention are essential to manage the weight of the world.</s>
