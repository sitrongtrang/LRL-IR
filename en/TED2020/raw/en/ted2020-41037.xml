 <s id="1">It’s an increasingly common sight in hospitals around the world: a nurse measures our height, weight, blood pressure, and attaches a glowing plastic clip to our finger.</s>
 <s id="2">Suddenly, a digital screen reads out the oxygen level in our bloodstream.</s>
 <s id="3">How did that happen?</s>
 <s id="4">How can a plastic clip learn something about our blood… without a blood sample?</s>
 <s id="5">Here’s the trick: our bodies are translucent, meaning they don’t completely block and reflect light.</s>
 <s id="6">Rather, they allow some light to actually pass through our skin, muscles, and blood vessels.</s>
 <s id="7">Don’t believe it?</s>
 <s id="8">Hold a flashlight to your thumb.</s>
 <s id="9">Light, it turns out, can help probe the insides of our bodies.</s>
 <s id="10">Consider that medical fingerclip— it’s called a pulse oximeter.</s>
 <s id="11">When you inhale, your lungs transfer oxygen into hemoglobin molecules, and the pulse oximeter measures the ratio of oxygenated to oxygen-free hemoglobin.</s>
 <s id="12">It does this by using a tiny red LED light on one side of the fingerclip, and a small light detector on the other.</s>
 <s id="13">When the LED shines into your finger, oxygen-free hemoglobin in your blood vessels absorbs the red light more strongly than its oxygenated counterpart.</s>
 <s id="14">So the amount of light that makes it out the other side depends on the concentration ratio of the two types of hemoglobin.</s>
 <s id="15">But any two patients will have different-sized blood vessels in their fingers.</s>
 <s id="16">For one patient, a saturation reading of ninety-five percent corresponds to a healthy oxygen level, but for another with smaller arteries, the same reading could dangerously misrepresent the actual oxygen level.</s>
 <s id="17">This can be accounted for with a second infrared wavelength LED.</s>
 <s id="18">Light comes in a vast spectrum of wavelengths, and infrared light lies just beyond the visible colors.</s>
 <s id="19">All molecules, including hemoglobin, absorb light at different efficiencies across this spectrum.</s>
 <s id="20">So contrasting the absorbance of red to infrared light provides a chemical fingerprint to eliminate the blood vessel size effect.</s>
 <s id="21">Today, an emerging medical sensor industry is exploring all-new degrees of precision chemical fingerprinting, using tiny light-manipulating devices no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.</s>
 <s id="22">This microscopic technology, called integrated photonics, is made from wires of silicon that guide light— like water in a pipe— to redirect, reshape, even temporarily trap it.</s>
 <s id="23">A ring resonator device, which is a circular wire of silicon, is a light trapper that enhances chemical fingerprinting.</s>
 <s id="24">When placed close to a silicon wire, a ring siphons off and temporarily stores only certain waves of light— those whose periodic wavelength fits a whole number of times along the ring’s circumference.</s>
 <s id="25">It’s the same effect at work when we pluck guitar strings.</s>
 <s id="26">Only certain vibrating patterns dominate a string of a particular length, to give a fundamental note and its overtones.</s>
 <s id="27">Ring resonators were originally designed to efficiently route different wavelengths of light— each a channel of digital data— in fiber optics communication networks.</s>
 <s id="28">But some day this kind of data traffic routing may be adapted for miniature chemical fingerprinting labs, on chips the size of a penny.</s>
 <s id="29">These future labs-on-a-chip may easily, rapidly, and non-invasively detect a host of illnesses, by analyzing human saliva or sweat in a doctor’s office or the convenience of our homes.</s>
 <s id="30">Human saliva in particular mirrors the composition of our bodies’ proteins and hormones, and can give early-warning signals for certain cancers and infectious and autoimmune diseases.</s>
 <s id="31">To accurately identify an illness, labs-on-a-chip may rely on several methods, including chemical fingerprinting, to sift through the large mix of trace substances in a sample of spit.</s>
 <s id="32">Various biomolecules in saliva absorb light at the same wavelength— but each has a distinct chemical fingerprint.</s>
 <s id="33">In a lab-on-a-chip, after the light passes through a saliva sample, a host of fine-tuned rings may each siphon off a slightly different wavelength of light and send it to a partner light detector.</s>
 <s id="34">Together, this bank of detectors will resolve the cumulative chemical fingerprint of the sample.</s>
 <s id="35">From this information, a tiny on-chip computer, containing a library of chemical fingerprints for different molecules, may figure out their relative concentrations, and help diagnose a specific illness.</s>
 <s id="36">From globe-trotting communications to labs-on-a-chip, humankind has repurposed light to both carry and extract information.</s>
 <s id="37">Its ability to illuminate continues to astonish us with new discoveries.</s>
