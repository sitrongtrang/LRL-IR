 <s id="1">I remember one morning when I was in the third grade, my mom sent me to school with a Ghanaian staple dish called "fufu."</s>
 <s id="2">(Laughter) Fufu is this white ball of starch made of cassava, and it's served with light soup, which is a dark orange color, and contains chicken and/or beef.</s>
 <s id="3">It's a savory, flavorful dish that my mom thought would keep me warm on a cold day.</s>
 <s id="4">When I got to lunch and I opened my thermos, releasing these new smells into the air, my friends did not react favorably.</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) "What's that?" one of them asked.</s>
 <s id="6">"It's fufu," I responded.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">(Laughter) "Ew, that smells funny.</s>
  <s id="7.2">What's a fufu?" they asked.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">Their reaction made me lose my appetite.</s>
 <s id="9">I begged my mother to never send me to school with fufu again.</s>
 <s id="10">I asked her to make me sandwiches or chicken noodle soup or any of the other foods that my friends were eating.</s>
 <s id="11">And this is one of the first times I began to notice the distinction between what was unique to my family and what was common for everyone else, what was Ghanaian and what was African and what was American.</s>
 <s id="12">I'm a first-generation American.</s>
 <s id="13">Both of my parents are immigrants.</s>
 <s id="14">In fact, my father, Gabriel, came to the US almost 50 years ago.</s>
 <s id="15">He arrived in New York from a city called Kumasi in a northern region of Ghana, in West Africa.</s>
 <s id="16">He came for school, earning his bachelor's degree in accounting and eventually became an accountant.</s>
 <s id="17">My mother, Georgina, joined him years later.</s>
 <s id="18">She had a love of fashion and worked in a sewing factory in lower Manhattan, until she saved up enough to open her own women's clothing store.</s>
 <s id="19">I consider myself an American and an African and a Ghanaian.</s>
 <s id="20">And there's millions of people around the world who are juggling these different classifications.</s>
 <s id="21">They might be Jamaican-Canadians or Korean-Americans or Nigerian-Brits.</s>
 <s id="22">But what makes our stories and experiences different is that we were born and raised in a country different than our parents, and this can cause us to be misunderstood when being viewed through a narrow lens.</s>
 <s id="23">I grew up in New York, which is home to the largest number of immigrants anywhere in the United States.</s>
 <s id="24">And you would think growing up in a place like New York, it would be easy for a first-generation person to find their place.</s>
 <s id="25">But all throughout my childhood, there were these moments that formed my understanding of the different worlds I belonged to.</s>
 <s id="26">When I was in the fifth grade, a student asked me if my family was refugees.</s>
 <s id="27">I didn't know what that word meant.</s>
 <s id="28">He explained to me that his parents told him that refugees are people from Africa who come to the US to escape death, starvation and disease.</s>
 <s id="29">So I asked my parents, and they laughed a bit, not because it was funny but because it was a generalization.</s>
 <s id="30">And they assured me that they had enough to eat in Ghana and came to the US willingly.</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) These questions became more complex as I got older.</s>
 <s id="32">Junior high school was the first time I went to school with a large number of black American students, and many of them couldn't understand why I sounded differently than they did or why my parents seemed different than theirs.</s>
 <s id="33">"Are you even black?" a student asked.</s>
 <s id="34">I mean, I thought I was black.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) I thought my skin complexion settled that.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) I asked my father about it, and he shared his own confusion over the significance of that when he first came to the US.</s>
 <s id="37">He explained to me that, when he was in Ghana, everyone was black, so he never thought about it.</s>
 <s id="38">But in the US, it's a thing.</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) But he would say, "But you're African.</s>
 <s id="40">Remember that."</s>
 <s id="41">And he would emphasize this, even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American.</s>
 <s id="42">These misconceptions and complex cultural issues are not just the inquiries of children.</s>
 <s id="43">Adults don't know who immigrants are.</s>
 <s id="44">If we look at current trends, if I asked you: What's the fastest-growing immigrant demographic in the United States, who would you think it was?</s>
 <s id="45">Nine out of 10 people tell me it's Latinos, but it's actually African immigrants.</s>
 <s id="46">How about in academics?</s>
 <s id="47">What's the most educated immigrant demographic?</s>
 <s id="48">A lot of people presume it to be Asians, but it's actually African immigrants.</s>
 <s id="49">Even in matters of policy, did you know that three out of the eight countries in the so-called "travel ban" are African countries?</s>
 <s id="50">A lot of people assume those targeted Muslims only live in the Middle East, but a lot of those banned people are Africans.</s>
 <s id="51">So on these issues of education and policy and religion, a lot of things we presume about immigrants are incorrect.</s>
 <s id="52">Even if we look at something like workplace diversity and inclusion, if I asked you what gender-ethnicity combination is least likely to be promoted to senior managerial positions, who would you think it was?</s>
 <s id="53">The answer is not Africans this time.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) And it's not black women or men, and it's not Latin women or men.</s>
 <s id="55">It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.</s>
 <s id="56">Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work as a digital storyteller that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.</s>
 <s id="57">This year, I launched an online gallery of portraits and firsthand accounts for a project called Enodi.</s>
 <s id="58">The goal of Enodi is to highlight first-generation immigrants just like me who carry this kinship for the countries we grew up in, for the countries of origin and for this concept called "blackness."</s>
 <s id="59">I created this space to be a cyberhome for many of us who are misunderstood in our different home countries.</s>
 <s id="60">There are millions of Enodis who use hyphens to connect their countries of origin with their various homes in the US or Canada or Britain or Germany.</s>
 <s id="61">In fact, many people you might know are Enodi.</s>
 <s id="62">Actors Issa Rae and Idris Elba are Enodi.</s>
 <s id="63">Colin Powell, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former President of the United States, Barack Obama, are all the children of African or Caribbean immigrants.</s>
 <s id="64">But how much do you know about us?</s>
 <s id="65">This complicated navigation is not just the experience of first-generation folks.</s>
 <s id="66">We're so intertwined in the lives and culture of people in North America and Europe, that you might be surprised how critical we are to your histories and future.</s>
 <s id="67">So, engage us in conversation; discover who immigrants actually are, and see us apart from characterizations or limited media narratives or even who we might appear to be.</s>
 <s id="68">We're walking melting pots of culture, and if something in that pot smells new or different to you -- (Laughter) don't turn up your nose.</s>
 <s id="69">Ask us to share.</s>
 <s id="70">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="71">(Applause)</s>
