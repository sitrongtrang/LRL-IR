 <s id="1">I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.</s>
 <s id="2">But you have to have the right tools.</s>
 <s id="3">If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.</s>
 <s id="4">And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands.</s>
 <s id="5">So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of: Play-Doh.</s>
 <s id="6">And so we spent a summer looking at different Play-Doh recipes.</s>
 <s id="7">And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade play-dough -- pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.</s>
 <s id="8">We have two favorite recipes -- one that has these ingredients and a second that had sugar instead of salt.</s>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">And they're great.</s>
  <s id="9.2">We can make great little sculptures with these.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.</s>
 <s id="11">You see that really salty Play-Doh?</s>
 <s id="12">Well, it conducts electricity.</s>
 <s id="13">And this is nothing new.</s>
 <s id="14">It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.</s>
 <s id="15">But our homemade play-dough actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.</s>
 <s id="16">And that sugar dough?</s>
 <s id="17">Well it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.</s>
 <s id="18">So what does that mean?</s>
 <s id="19">Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits -- circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands can build on their own.</s>
 <s id="20">(Applause) And so I want to do a little demo for you.</s>
 <s id="21">So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in -- it's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack, you can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else -- we can actually then light things up.</s>
 <s id="22">But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit.</s>
 <s id="23">If I push these together, the light turns off.</s>
 <s id="24">Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.</s>
 <s id="25">If I separate them again, I have some light.</s>
 <s id="26">Well now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.</s>
 <s id="27">It's like a wall to the electricity.</s>
 <s id="28">If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light.</s>
 <s id="29">In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.</s>
 <s id="30">If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning.</s>
 <s id="31">(Applause) And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.</s>
 <p id="p32">
  <s id="32.1">We call this our sushi circuit.</s>
  <s id="32.2">It's very popular with kids.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="33">I plug in again the power to it.</s>
 <s id="34">And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.</s>
 <s id="35">I can start plugging in lots of lights.</s>
 <s id="36">And we can start talking about things like electrical load.</s>
 <s id="37">What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor?</s>
 <s id="38">It'll dim.</s>
 <s id="39">We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.</s>
 <s id="40">You could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this.</s>
 <s id="41">So this is all in your home kitchen.</s>
 <s id="42">We've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">We have a website, it's all there.</s>
  <s id="43.2">These are the home recipes.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">We've got some videos.</s>
  <s id="44.2">You can make them yourselves.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.</s>
 <s id="46">We've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids, to a science researcher in the U.K., and curriculum developers in Hawaii.</s>
 <s id="47">So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.</s>
 <s id="48">We don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers, but maybe we should.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Have fun.</s>
  <s id="49.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">(Applause)</s>
