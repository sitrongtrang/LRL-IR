 <s id="1">The vast majority of people who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape, but in complete lifelike detail.</s>
 <s id="2">They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail.</s>
 <s id="3">And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born without a limb can feel a phantom.</s>
 <s id="4">So what causes phantom limb sensations?</s>
 <s id="5">The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map of the body in our brains.</s>
 <s id="6">And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb to feel one implies we are born with at least the beginnings of this map.</s>
 <s id="7">But one thing sets the phantoms that appear after amputation apart from their flesh and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful.</s>
 <s id="8">To fully understand phantom limbs and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway from limb to brain.</s>
 <s id="9">Our limbs are full of sensory neurons responsible for everything from the textures we feel with our fingertips to our understanding of where our bodies are in space.</s>
 <s id="10">Neural pathways carry this sensory input through the spinal cord and up to the brain.</s>
 <s id="11">Since so much of this path lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains behind after an amputation.</s>
 <s id="12">But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel at every step of the pathway.</s>
 <s id="13">At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals even in response to mild pressure.</s>
 <s id="14">Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.</s>
 <s id="15">For reasons we don’t fully understand, after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify.</s>
 <s id="16">Once they pass through the spinal cord, sensory signals reach the brain.</s>
 <s id="17">There, the somatosensory cortex processes them.</s>
 <s id="18">The entire body is mapped in this cortex.</s>
 <s id="19">Sensitive body parts with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas.</s>
 <s id="20">The cortical homunculus is a model of the human body with proportions based on the size of each body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input the brain receives from that body part.</s>
 <s id="21">For example, representation of the left hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists.</s>
 <s id="22">The brain also increases cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations that alert us to danger.</s>
 <s id="23">This increased representation can lead to phantom pain.</s>
 <s id="24">The cortical map is also most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts that are no longer there, because they still have representation in the brain.</s>
 <s id="25">Over time, this representation may shrink and the phantom limb may shrink with it.</s>
 <s id="26">But phantom limb sensations don’t necessarily disappear on their own.</s>
 <s id="27">Treatment for phantom pain usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time.</s>
 <s id="28">A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb.</s>
 <s id="29">The patient places the phantom limb into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb in front of the mirror.</s>
 <s id="30">This tricks the brain into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it.</s>
 <s id="31">Scientists are developing virtual reality treatments that make the experience of mirror box therapy even more lifelike.</s>
 <s id="32">Prosthetics can also create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove their prosthetics at night.</s>
 <s id="33">And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively.</s>
 <s id="34">There are still many questions about phantom limbs.</s>
 <s id="35">We don’t know why some amputees escape the pain typically associated with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all.</s>
 <s id="36">And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people who experience them.</s>
 <s id="37">A deeper understanding of these apparitions will give us insight into the work our brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it.</s>
 <s id="38">They’re an important reminder that the realities we experience are, in fact, subjective.</s>
