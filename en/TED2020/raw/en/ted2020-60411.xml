 <s id="1">In their ramshackle hut on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair.</s>
 <s id="2">The woman had just given birth to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly running out of food and money.</s>
 <s id="3">The father walked into the woods to ponder their problem.</s>
 <s id="4">After hours spent wandering through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes.</s>
 <s id="5">The first figure appeared to be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil.</s>
 <s id="6">Both figures offered to lighten the man’s burden, and act as Godfather to his most recent child.</s>
 <s id="7">But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those who passed judgment on human life.</s>
 <s id="8">He ventured deeper into the tangled thicket.</s>
 <s id="9">Here in the darkest part of the woods, the father made out a third figure.</s>
 <s id="10">Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, which broke into a crooked smile.</s>
 <s id="11">This was Death himself, come to offer his services as Godfather.</s>
 <s id="12">He promised to return when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity.</s>
 <s id="13">The father— knowing that all people are equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer.</s>
 <s id="14">Years later, when the child had grown into an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather came for his promised visit.</s>
 <s id="15">In his gnarled hand he held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments.</s>
 <s id="16">Death had brought this flask for his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor.</s>
 <s id="17">But the powerful potion came with very strict rules.</s>
 <s id="18">If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering at the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with just a waft of the antidote’s fumes.</s>
 <s id="19">But if Death lingered at the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient as his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them.</s>
 <s id="20">In time, the doctor’s potent potion and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land.</s>
 <s id="21">He grew rich and famous, casting off the hardships of his early life.</s>
 <s id="22">When the king fell ill, he summoned the famous physician to treat him.</s>
 <s id="23">The doctor swept into the palace, ready to show off his skills.</s>
 <s id="24">But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death settled at the foot of the bed.</s>
 <s id="25">The doctor desperately wanted the glory of saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather.</s>
 <s id="26">And so, he swiftly spun the bed around and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free to administer the antidote.</s>
 <s id="27">Death was livid.</s>
 <s id="28">He warned his arrogant Godson that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life.</s>
 <s id="29">Death and the doctor continued their travels.</s>
 <s id="30">After some time, the king’s messengers came to collect the doctor yet again.</s>
 <s id="31">The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible riches to anyone who could cure her.</s>
 <s id="32">The doctor approached the princesses’ chamber with gold in his eyes.</s>
 <s id="33">But upon seeing the sleeping princess, his greed fell away.</s>
 <s id="34">He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice Death lurking by her feet.</s>
 <s id="35">He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter her thanks, Death had dragged his lovesick Godson away.</s>
 <s id="36">In an instant, the palace dissolved around them.</s>
 <s id="37">The doctor found himself in an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles, each representing the duration of a life.</s>
 <s id="38">As punishment for his Godson’s foolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle down to its wick.</s>
 <s id="39">Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear he’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes.</s>
 <s id="40">Desperately, he begged Death to transfer his dying light onto a new candle.</s>
 <s id="41">His Godfather considered the request— but the doctor’s betrayal was too great.</s>
 <s id="42">He loosened his bony grip, and his Godson’s candle fell to the floor.</s>
 <s id="43">Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face fixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor was a wisp of smoke.</s>
