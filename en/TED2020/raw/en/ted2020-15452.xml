 <s id="1">Listen to the sounds of why hearing matters to the Alaskan Native people.</s>
 <s id="2">Hearing loss makes it hard to fish on the open water, hunt caribou and harvest berries, activities central to Alaskan Native culture.</s>
 <s id="3">Hearing loss isn't unique to rural Alaska.</s>
 <s id="4">It's global.</s>
 <s id="5">The Global Burden of Disease Project estimates there are 1.1 billion people living with hearing loss worldwide.</s>
 <s id="6">That's more people than the entire population here in sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
 <s id="7">Over 80 percent are in low- and middle-income countries, and many have no access to hearing care.</s>
 <s id="8">The impact on people's lives is tremendous.</s>
 <s id="9">Anuk is a three-year-old boy I treated in Alaska.</s>
 <s id="10">Ear infections started when he was barely four months old.</s>
 <s id="11">His parents brought him into clinic, worried he didn't say much compared to his brothers.</s>
 <s id="12">Sure enough, many rounds of infections had resulted in hearing loss.</s>
 <s id="13">Without treatment, Anuk's speech will continue to lag behind.</s>
 <s id="14">He's more likely to do worse in school, have worse job prospects and experience social isolation.</s>
 <s id="15">But it doesn't have to be this way.</s>
 <s id="16">The World Health Organization estimates that half of all global hearing loss can be prevented.</s>
 <s id="17">If Anuk's hearing loss is identified and treated promptly, his life and the opportunities he has as he grows up could look vastly different.</s>
 <s id="18">I'm an ear surgeon working with partners around the world on new pathways for hearing loss prevention.</s>
 <s id="19">This solution comes from my collaboration with a tribal health organization called the Norton Sound Health Corporation.</s>
 <s id="20">Hearing loss evaluation traditionally requires testing by an audiologist in a soundproof room, with a lot of permanent equipment.</s>
 <s id="21">An ear surgeon then examines Anuk's ears under a microscope and decides a treatment plan.</s>
 <s id="22">These resources simply aren't available in remote settings.</s>
 <s id="23">In a state where 75 percent of communities aren't connected to a hospital by road, an expensive flight is required.</s>
 <s id="24">To overcome these barriers, Alaska has developed a state-of-the-art telemedicine system that connects over 250 village health clinics with specialists who triage all types of health concerns.</s>
 <s id="25">My colleagues have validated that ear-related telemedicine consults are equivalent to an in-person exam.</s>
 <s id="26">In 2016, travel was prevented for 91 percent of patients receiving specialty telemedicine in the Norton Sound region.</s>
 <s id="27">Telemedicine has saved over 18 million in travel costs in this single region over the past 15 years.</s>
 <s id="28">Our team is taking the power of telemedicine to a new level, through a project funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.</s>
 <s id="29">For the first time, we are merging telemedicine with mobile screening technology that extends the reach of expert triage beyond health care settings.</s>
 <s id="30">This cell-based screen, developed in South Africa, costs over 10 times less than traditional equipment and does not require advanced training.</s>
 <s id="31">If I were screening Anuk at school, sound-attenuating headphones and noise monitoring would take the place of a sound booth, and I would use a phone adapter instead of a microscope to examine his ears.</s>
 <s id="32">In a matter of minutes, screening and images are done.</s>
 <s id="33">We then apply Alaska telemedicine technology to transmit the data to specialists, who connect Anuk to the treatment he needs.</s>
 <s id="34">Our team is launching a randomized trial in 15 communities along the Bering Sea to study how well this intervention works.</s>
 <s id="35">Our goal is to prevent childhood hearing loss across the state of Alaska.</s>
 <s id="36">But the concept is bigger than a single state.</s>
 <s id="37">The impact is global.</s>
 <s id="38">Mobile telemedicine can revolutionize access to care.</s>
 <s id="39">In Malawi, for example, there are only two ear surgeons and 11 audiologists for a population of 17 million.</s>
 <s id="40">This technology could empower teachers and community health workers to provide access to care to children in places like Malawi.</s>
 <s id="41">Scaling up globally could change children's lives who have never had access to hearing care before, using just the power of a cell phone.</s>
 <s id="42">It's time to change the course of preventable hearing loss.</s>
 <s id="43">Anuk and countless children like him are depending on us.</s>
 <s id="44">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="45">(Applause)</s>
