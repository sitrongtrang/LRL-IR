 <s id="1">When we talk about English, we often think of it as a single language but what do the dialects spoken in dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer?</s>
 <s id="2">And how are any of them related to the strange words in Beowulf?</s>
 <s id="3">The answer is that like most languages, English has evolved through generations of speakers, undergoing major changes over time.</s>
 <s id="4">By undoing these changes, we can trace the language from the present day back to its ancient roots.</s>
 <s id="5">While modern English shares many similar words with Latin-derived romance languages, like French and Spanish, most of those words were not originally part of it.</s>
 <s id="6">Instead, they started coming into the language with the Norman invasion of England in 1066.</s>
 <s id="7">When the French-speaking Normans conquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them, adding a massive amount of French and Latin vocabulary to the English language previously spoken there.</s>
 <s id="8">Today, we call that language Old English.</s>
 <s id="9">This is the language of Beowulf.</s>
 <s id="10">It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more recognizable if you know some German.</s>
 <s id="11">That's because Old English belongs to the Germanic language family, first brought to the British Isles in the 5th and 6th centuries by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.</s>
 <s id="12">The Germanic dialects they spoke would become known as Anglo-Saxon.</s>
 <s id="13">Viking invaders in the 8th to 11th centuries added more borrowings from Old Norse into the mix.</s>
 <s id="14">It may be hard to see the roots of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French, Latin, Old Norse and other languages.</s>
 <s id="15">But comparative linguistics can help us by focusing on grammatical structure, patterns of sound changes, and certain core vocabulary.</s>
 <s id="16">For example, after the 6th century, German words starting with "p," systematically shifted to a "pf" sound while their Old English counterparts kept the "p" unchanged.</s>
 <s id="17">In another split, words that have "sk" sounds in Swedish developed an "sh" sound in English.</s>
 <s id="18">There are still some English words with "sk," like "skirt," and "skull," but they're direct borrowings from Old Norse that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.</s>
 <s id="19">These examples show us that just as the various Romance languages descended from Latin, English, Swedish, German, and many other languages descended from their own common ancestor known as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 B.C.E.</s>
 <s id="20">Because this historical language was never written down, we can only reconstruct it by comparing its descendants, which is possible thanks to the consistency of the changes.</s>
 <s id="21">We can even use the same process to go back one step further, and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic to a language called Proto-Indo-European, spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe in modern day Ukraine and Russia.</s>
 <s id="22">This is the reconstructed ancestor of the Indo-European family that includes nearly all languages historically spoken in Europe, as well as large parts of Southern and Western Asia.</s>
 <s id="23">And though it requires a bit more work, we can find the same systematic similarities, or correspondences, between related words in different Indo-European branches.</s>
 <s id="24">Comparing English with Latin, we see that English has "t" where Latin has "d", and "f" where latin has "p" at the start of words.</s>
 <s id="25">Some of English's more distant relatives include Hindi, Persian and the Celtic languages it displaced in what is now Britain.</s>
 <s id="26">Proto-Indo-European itself descended from an even more ancient language, but unfortunately, this is as far back as historical and archeological evidence will allow us to go.</s>
 <s id="27">Many mysteries remain just out of reach, such as whether there might be a link between Indo-European and other major language families, and the nature of the languages spoken in Europe prior to its arrival.</s>
 <s id="28">But the amazing fact remains that nearly 3 billion people around the world, many of whom cannot understand each other, are nevertheless speaking the same words shaped by 6000 years of history.</s>
