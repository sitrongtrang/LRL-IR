 <s id="1">So this is James Risen.</s>
 <s id="2">You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times.</s>
 <s id="3">Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name, Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.</s>
 <s id="4">But it's another chapter in that book that may have an even more lasting impact.</s>
 <s id="5">In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints of a nuclear bomb to Iran.</s>
 <s id="6">If that sounds crazy, go read it.</s>
 <s id="7">It's an incredible story.</s>
 <s id="8">But you know who didn't like that chapter?</s>
 <s id="9">The US government.</s>
 <s id="10">For nearly a decade afterwards, Risen was the subject of a US government investigation in which prosecutors demanded that he testify against one of his alleged sources.</s>
 <s id="11">And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.</s>
 <s id="12">You see, under the First Amendment, the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.</s>
 <s id="13">But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news and protect the identities of the brave men and women who get it to them.</s>
 <s id="14">So when the government came knocking, Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him: he refused and said he'd rather go to jail.</s>
 <s id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.</s>
 <s id="16">That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.</s>
 <s id="17">Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case, the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.</s>
 <s id="18">It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance, there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.</s>
 <s id="19">And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify, they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.</s>
 <s id="20">So completely in secret and without his consent, prosecutors got Risen's phone records.</s>
 <s id="21">They got his email records, his financial and banking information, his credit reports, even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.</s>
 <s id="22">And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.</s>
 <s id="23">Sadly, this is only one case of many.</s>
 <s id="24">President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers, and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more than all other administrations combined.</s>
 <s id="25">Now, you can see how this could be a problem, especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.</s>
 <s id="26">Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.</s>
 <s id="27">So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the First Amendment is supposed to protect because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.</s>
 <s id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent reporters' rights, the press can also use technology to protect their sources even better than before.</s>
 <s id="29">And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them, rather than on the witness stand after the fact.</s>
 <s id="30">Communications software now exists that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book, and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.</s>
 <s id="31">For example, one such tool is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower submission system that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz, and is now developed at the non-profit where I work, Freedom of the Press Foundation.</s>
 <s id="32">Instead of sending an email, you go to a news organization's website, like this one here on The Washington Post.</s>
 <s id="33">From there, you can upload a document or send information much like you would on any other contact form.</s>
 <s id="34">It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server that only the news organization has access to.</s>
 <s id="35">So the government can no longer secretly demand the information, and much of the information they would demand wouldn't be available in the first place.</s>
 <s id="36">SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.</s>
 <s id="37">Unfortunately, governments all over the world are constantly developing new spying techniques that put us all at risk.</s>
 <s id="38">And it's up to us going forward to make sure that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers, like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.</s>
 <s id="39">It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower alerting us to overcrowded hospitals, or the next environmental worker sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water, or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.</s>
 <s id="40">After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women who expose crimes, but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.</s>
 <s id="41">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="42">(Applause)</s>
