  <s id="2.3">[Daniel Engber on the Progress Bar] The progress bar is just an indicator on a computer that something's happening inside the device.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">The classic one that's been used for years is a horizontal bar.</s>
 <s id="4">I mean, this goes back to pre-computer versions of this on ledgers, where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right to show how much of a task they had completed at a factory.</s>
 <s id="5">This is just the same thing on a screen.</s>
 <s id="6">Something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as "the software crisis," where suddenly, computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone had been prepared for, from a design perspective.</s>
 <s id="7">People were using percent-done indicators in different ways.</s>
 <s id="8">So you might have a graphical countdown clock, or they would have a line of asterisks that would fill out from left to right on a screen.</s>
 <s id="9">But no one had done a systematic survey of these things and tried to figure out: How do they actually affect the user's experience of sitting at the computer?</s>
 <s id="10">This graduate student named Brad Myers, in 1985, decided he would study this.</s>
 <s id="11">He found that it didn't really matter if the percent-done indicator was giving you the accurate percent done.</s>
 <s id="12">What mattered was that it was there at all.</s>
 <s id="13">Just seeing it there made people feel better, and that was the most surprising thing.</s>
 <s id="14">He has all these ideas about what this thing could do.</s>
 <s id="15">Maybe it could make people relax effectively.</s>
 <s id="16">Maybe it would allow people to turn away from their machine and do something else of exactly the right duration.</s>
 <s id="17">They would look and say, "Oh, the progress bar is half done.</s>
 <s id="18">That took five minutes.</s>
 <s id="19">So now I have five minutes to send this fax," or whatever people were doing in 1985.</s>
 <s id="20">Both of those things are wrong.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">Like, when you see that progress bar, it sort of locks your attention in a tractor beam, and it turns the experience of waiting into this exciting narrative that you're seeing unfold in front of you: that somehow, this time you've spent waiting in frustration for the computer to do something, has been reconceptualized as: "Progress!</s>
  <s id="21.2">Oh!</s>
  <s id="21.3">Great stuff is happening!"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">[Progress...]</s>
  <s id="22.2">But once you start thinking about the progress bar as something that's more about dulling the pain of waiting, well, then you can start fiddling around with the psychology.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">So if you have a progress bar that just moves at a constant rate -- let's say, that's really what's happening in the computer -- that will feel to people like it's slowing down.</s>
 <s id="24">We get bored.</s>
 <s id="25">Well, now you can start trying to enhance it and make it appear to move more quickly than it really is, make it move faster at the beginning, like a burst of speed.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">That's exciting, people feel like, "Oh!</s>
  <s id="26.2">Something's really happening!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">Then you can move back into a more naturalistic growth of the progress bar as you go along.</s>
 <s id="28">You're assuming that people are focusing on the passage of time -- they're trying to watch grass grow, they're trying to watch a pot of water, waiting for it to boil, and you're just trying to make that less boring, less painful and less frustrating than it was before.</s>
 <s id="29">So the progress bar at least gives you the vision of a beginning and an end, and you're working towards a goal.</s>
 <s id="30">I think in some ways, it mitigates the fear of death.</s>
 <s id="31">Too much?</s>
