 <s id="1">I'd like to take you to another world.</s>
 <s id="2">And I'd like to share a 45 year-old love story with the poor, living on less than one dollar a day.</s>
 <s id="3">I went to a very elitist, snobbish, expensive education in India, and that almost destroyed me.</s>
 <s id="4">I was all set to be a diplomat, teacher, doctor -- all laid out.</s>
 <s id="5">Then, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion for three years.</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) The whole world was laid out for me.</s>
 <s id="7">Everything was at my feet.</s>
 <s id="8">I could do nothing wrong.</s>
 <s id="9">And then I thought out of curiosity I'd like to go and live and work and just see what a village is like.</s>
 <s id="10">So in 1965, I went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India, and I saw starvation, death, people dying of hunger, for the first time.</s>
 <s id="11">It changed my life.</s>
 <s id="12">I came back home, told my mother, "I'd like to live and work in a village."</s>
 <s id="13">Mother went into a coma.</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) "What is this?</s>
 <s id="15">The whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you, and you want to go and work in a village?</s>
 <s id="16">I mean, is there something wrong with you?"</s>
 <s id="17">I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.</s>
 <s id="18">It made me think.</s>
 <s id="19">And I wanted to give something back in my own way."</s>
 <s id="20">"What do you want to do in a village?</s>
 <s id="21">No job, no money, no security, no prospect."</s>
 <s id="22">I said, "I want to live and dig wells for five years."</s>
 <s id="23">"Dig wells for five years?</s>
 <s id="24">You went to the most expensive school and college in India, and you want to dig wells for five years?"</s>
 <s id="25">She didn't speak to me for a very long time, because she thought I'd let my family down.</s>
 <s id="26">But then, I was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills that very poor people have, which are never brought into the mainstream -- which is never identified, respected, applied on a large scale.</s>
 <s id="27">And I thought I'd start a Barefoot College -- college only for the poor.</s>
 <s id="28">What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college.</s>
 <s id="29">I went to this village for the first time.</s>
 <s id="30">Elders came to me and said, "Are you running from the police?"</s>
 <s id="31">I said, "No."</s>
 <s id="32">(Laughter) "You failed in your exam?"</s>
 <s id="33">I said, "No."</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">"You didn't get a government job?"</s>
  <s id="34.2">I said, "No."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">"What are you doing here?</s>
 <s id="36">Why are you here?</s>
 <s id="37">The education system in India makes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich; what are you doing in this village?</s>
 <s id="38">Is there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"</s>
 <s id="39">I said, "No, I want to actually start a college only for the poor.</s>
 <s id="40">What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."</s>
 <s id="41">So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.</s>
 <s id="42">They said, "Please, don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college."</s>
 <s id="43">So it's the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come.</s>
 <s id="44">You have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout to come to our college.</s>
 <s id="45">You have to work with your hands.</s>
 <s id="46">You have to have a dignity of labor.</s>
 <s id="47">You have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community.</s>
 <s id="48">So we started the Barefoot College, and we redefined professionalism.</s>
 <s id="49">Who is a professional?</s>
 <s id="50">A professional is someone who has a combination of competence, confidence and belief.</s>
 <s id="51">A water diviner is a professional.</s>
 <s id="52">A traditional midwife is a professional.</s>
 <s id="53">A traditional bone setter is a professional.</s>
 <s id="54">These are professionals all over the world.</s>
 <s id="55">You find them in any inaccessible village around the world.</s>
 <s id="56">And we thought that these people should come into the mainstream and show that the knowledge and skills that they have is universal.</s>
 <s id="57">It needs to be used, needs to be applied, needs to be shown to the world outside -- that these knowledge and skills are relevant even today.</s>
 <s id="58">So the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.</s>
 <s id="59">You eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.</s>
 <s id="60">There are no contracts, no written contracts.</s>
 <s id="61">You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.</s>
 <s id="62">And no one can get more than $100 a month.</s>
 <s id="63">You come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.</s>
 <s id="64">You come for the work and the challenge, you'll come to the Barefoot College.</s>
 <s id="65">That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.</s>
 <s id="66">Whatever idea you have, come and try it.</s>
 <s id="67">It doesn't matter if you fail.</s>
 <s id="68">Battered, bruised, you start again.</s>
 <s id="69">It's the only college where the teacher is the learner and the learner is the teacher.</s>
 <s id="70">And it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.</s>
 <s id="71">You are certified by the community you serve.</s>
 <s id="72">You don't need a paper to hang on the wall to show that you are an engineer.</s>
 <p id="p73">
  <s id="73.1">So when I said that, they said, "Well show us what is possible.</s>
  <s id="73.2">What are you doing?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="74">This is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."</s>
 <s id="75">So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986.</s>
 <s id="76">It was built by 12 Barefoot architects who can't read and write, built on $1.50 a sq. ft.</s>
 <s id="77">150 people lived there, worked there.</s>
 <s id="78">They got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.</s>
 <s id="79">But then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.</s>
 <s id="80">I said, "Yes, they made the blueprints, but the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."</s>
 <s id="81">We are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000, because they didn't believe us, and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.</s>
 <s id="82">I asked a forester -- high-powered, paper-qualified expert -- I said, "What can you build in this place?"</s>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">He had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it.</s>
  <s id="83.2">No way.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="84">Not even worth it.</s>
 <s id="85">No water, rocky soil."</s>
 <s id="86">I was in a bit of a spot.</s>
 <p id="p87">
  <s id="87.1">And I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village and say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"</s>
  <s id="87.2">He looked quietly at me and said, "You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="88">This is what it looks like today.</s>
 <s id="89">Went to the roof, and all the women said, "Clear out.</s>
 <s id="90">The men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.</s>
 <s id="91">This is waterproofing the roof."</s>
 <s id="92">(Laughter) It is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens and a bit of other things I don't know.</s>
 <s id="93">But it actually doesn't leak.</s>
 <s id="94">Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.</s>
 <s id="95">This technology, the women will not share with the men.</s>
 <s id="96">(Laughter) It's the only college which is fully solar-electrified.</s>
 <s id="97">All the power comes from the sun.</s>
 <s id="98">45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.</s>
 <s id="99">And everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.</s>
 <s id="100">So long as the sun shines, we'll have no problem with power.</s>
 <s id="101">But the beauty is that is was installed by a priest, a Hindu priest, who's only done eight years of primary schooling -- never been to school, never been to college.</s>
 <s id="102">He knows more about solar than anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.</s>
 <s id="103">Food, if you come to the Barefoot College, is solar cooked.</s>
 <s id="104">But the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women, illiterate women, who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker.</s>
 <s id="105">It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.</s>
 <s id="106">Unfortunately, they're almost half German, they're so precise.</s>
 <s id="107">(Laughter) You'll never find Indian women so precise.</s>
 <s id="108">Absolutely to the last inch, they can make that cooker.</s>
 <s id="109">And we have 60 meals twice a day of solar cooking.</s>
 <s id="110">We have a dentist -- she's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.</s>
 <s id="111">She actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children.</s>
 <s id="112">Barefoot technology: this was 1986 -- no engineer, no architect thought of it -- but we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.</s>
 <s id="113">Very little water is wasted.</s>
 <s id="114">All the roofs are connected underground to a 400,000 liter tank, and no water is wasted.</s>
 <s id="115">If we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus, because we collect rainwater.</s>
 <s id="116">60 percent of children don't go to school, because they have to look after animals -- sheep, goats -- domestic chores.</s>
 <s id="117">So we thought of starting a school at night for the children.</s>
 <s id="118">Because the night schools of Tilonia, over 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.</s>
 <s id="119">Because it's for the convenience of the child; it's not for the convenience of the teacher.</s>
 <s id="120">And what do we teach in these schools?</s>
 <s id="121">Democracy, citizenship, how you should measure your land, what you should do if you're arrested, what you should do if your animal is sick.</s>
 <s id="122">This is what we teach in the night schools.</s>
 <s id="123">But all the schools are solar-lit.</s>
 <s id="124">Every five years we have an election.</s>
 <s id="125">Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process, and they elect a prime minister.</s>
 <s id="126">The prime minister is 12 years old.</s>
 <s id="127">She looks after 20 goats in the morning, but she's prime minister in the evening.</s>
 <s id="128">She has a cabinet, a minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.</s>
 <s id="129">And they actually monitor and supervise 150 schools for 7,000 children.</s>
 <s id="130">She got the World's Children's Prize five years ago, and she went to Sweden.</s>
 <s id="131">First time ever going out of her village.</s>
 <s id="132">Never seen Sweden.</s>
 <s id="133">Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.</s>
 <s id="134">And the Queen of Sweden, who's there, turned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?</s>
 <s id="135">She's only 12 years old, and she's not dazzled by anything."</s>
 <s id="136">And the girl, who's on her left, turned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye and said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."</s>
 <s id="137">(Laughter) (Applause) Where the percentage of illiteracy is very high, we use puppetry.</s>
 <s id="138">Puppets is the way we communicate.</s>
 <s id="139">You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.</s>
 <p id="p140">
  <s id="140.1">He is my psychoanalyst.</s>
  <s id="140.2">He is my teacher.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p141">
  <s id="141.1">He's my doctor.</s>
  <s id="141.2">He's my lawyer.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="142">He's my donor.</s>
 <s id="143">He actually raises money, solves my disputes.</s>
 <s id="144">He solves my problems in the village.</s>
 <s id="145">If there's tension in the village, if attendance at the schools goes down and there's a friction between the teacher and the parent, the puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village and says, "Shake hands.</s>
 <s id="146">The attendance must not drop."</s>
 <s id="147">These puppets are made out of recycled World Bank reports.</s>
 <s id="148">(Laughter) (Applause) So this decentralized, demystified approach of solar-electrifying villages, we've covered all over India from Ladakh up to Bhutan -- all solar-electrified villages by people who have been trained.</s>
 <s id="149">And we went to Ladakh, and we asked this woman -- this, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof, because there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides -- and we asked this woman, "What was the benefit you had from solar electricity?"</s>
 <s id="150">And she thought for a minute and said, "It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."</s>
 <s id="151">(Laughter) Went to Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="152">One lesson we learned in India was men are untrainable.</s>
 <s id="153">(Laughter) Men are restless, men are ambitious, men are compulsively mobile, and they all want a certificate.</s>
 <s id="154">(Laughter) All across the globe, you have this tendency of men wanting a certificate.</s>
 <p id="p155">
  <s id="155.1">Why?</s>
  <s id="155.2">Because they want to leave the village and go to a city, looking for a job.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="156">So we came up with a great solution: train grandmothers.</s>
 <s id="157">What's the best way of communicating in the world today?</s>
 <p id="p158">
  <s id="158.1">Television?</s>
  <s id="158.2">No.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p159">
  <s id="159.1">Telegraph?</s>
  <s id="159.2">No.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p160">
  <s id="160.1">Telephone?</s>
  <s id="160.2">No.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="161">Tell a woman.</s>
 <s id="162">(Laughter) (Applause) So we went to Afghanistan for the first time, and we picked three women and said, "We want to take them to India."</s>
 <p id="p163">
  <s id="163.1">They said, "Impossible.</s>
  <s id="163.2">They don't even go out of their rooms, and you want to take them to India."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p164">
  <s id="164.1">I said, "I'll make a concession.</s>
  <s id="164.2">I'll take the husbands along as well."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="165">So I took the husbands along.</s>
 <s id="166">Of course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.</s>
 <s id="167">In six months, how do we train these women?</s>
 <s id="168">Sign language.</s>
 <s id="169">You don't choose the written word.</s>
 <s id="170">You don't choose the spoken word.</s>
 <s id="171">You use sign language.</s>
 <s id="172">And in six months they can become solar engineers.</s>
 <s id="173">They go back and solar-electrify their own village.</s>
 <s id="174">This woman went back and solar-electrified the first village, set up a workshop -- the first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan [was] by the three women.</s>
 <s id="175">This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.</s>
 <s id="176">55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="177">And they haven't collapsed.</s>
 <s id="178">She actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan and told the head of the department the difference between AC and DC.</s>
 <s id="179">He didn't know.</s>
 <s id="180">Those three women have trained 27 more women and solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="181">We went to Africa, and we did the same thing.</s>
 <s id="182">All these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries, all chatting to each other, not understanding a word, because they're all speaking a different language.</s>
 <s id="183">But their body language is great.</s>
 <s id="184">They're speaking to each other and actually becoming solar engineers.</s>
 <s id="185">I went to Sierra Leone, and there was this minister driving down in the dead of night -- comes across this village.</s>
 <s id="186">Comes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"</s>
 <p id="p187">
  <s id="187.1">They said, "These two grandmothers ... "</s>
  <s id="187.2">"Grandmothers?"</s>
  <s id="187.3">The minister couldn't believe what was happening.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p188">
  <s id="188.1">"Where did they go?"</s>
  <s id="188.2">"Went to India and back."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="189">Went straight to the president.</s>
 <s id="190">He said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"</s>
 <p id="p191">
  <s id="191.1">He said, "No."</s>
  <s id="191.2">Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="192">"What's the story."</s>
 <s id="193">So he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"</s>
 <s id="194">I said, "I can't, Mr. President.</s>
 <p id="p195">
  <s id="195.1">But they will.</s>
  <s id="195.2">The grandmothers will."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="196">So he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.</s>
 <s id="197">And 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.</s>
 <s id="198">Gambia: we went to select a grandmother in Gambia.</s>
 <s id="199">Went to this village.</s>
 <s id="200">I knew which woman I would like to take.</s>
 <s id="201">The community got together and said, "Take these two women."</s>
 <s id="202">I said, "No, I want to take this woman."</s>
 <p id="p203">
  <s id="203.1">They said, "Why?</s>
  <s id="203.2">She doesn't know the language.</s>
  <s id="203.3">You don't know her."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p204">
  <s id="204.1">I said, "I like the body language.</s>
  <s id="204.2">I like the way she speaks."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="205">"Difficult husband; not possible."</s>
 <p id="p206">
  <s id="206.1">Called the husband, the husband came, swaggering, politician, mobile in his hand.</s>
  <s id="206.2">"Not possible."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p207">
  <s id="207.1">"Why not?"</s>
  <s id="207.2">"The woman, look how beautiful she is."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="208">I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."</s>
 <s id="209">"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"</s>
 <s id="210">That was his biggest fear.</s>
 <p id="p211">
  <s id="211.1">I said, "She'll be happy.</s>
  <s id="211.2">She'll ring you up on the mobile."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="212">She went like a grandmother and came back like a tiger.</s>
 <s id="213">She walked out of the plane and spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.</s>
 <s id="214">She handled the national press, and she was a star.</s>
 <s id="215">And when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"</s>
 <p id="p216">
  <s id="216.1">"Oh, somewhere.</s>
  <s id="216.2">It doesn't matter."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="217">(Laughter) Success story.</s>
 <s id="218">(Laughter) (Applause) I'll just wind up by saying that I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.</s>
 <s id="219">Look for solutions within.</s>
 <p id="p220">
  <s id="220.1">And listen to people.</s>
  <s id="220.2">They have the solutions in front of you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="221">They're all over the world.</s>
 <s id="222">Don't even worry.</s>
 <s id="223">Don't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.</s>
 <s id="224">They have all the solutions in the world.</s>
 <s id="225">I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.</s>
 <s id="226">"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win."</s>
 <s id="227">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="228">(Applause)</s>
