 <s id="1">My name is Kate Hartman.</s>
 <s id="2">And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.</s>
 <s id="3">So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans, relate to ourselves, each other and the world around us.</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.</s>
 <s id="5">I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.</s>
 <s id="6">And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form.</s>
 <s id="7">And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.</s>
 <s id="8">And it's pretty simple.</s>
 <s id="9">Everybody's got one -- all of you.</s>
 <s id="10">I can guarantee, everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies.</s>
 <s id="11">Don't be ashamed.</s>
 <s id="12">It's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.</s>
 <s id="13">And so when working as an interaction designer, or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on, in or around the human form -- it's really a powerful space to work within.</s>
 <s id="14">So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.</s>
 <s id="15">So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.</s>
 <s id="16">And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with a hat.</s>
 <s id="17">And so it all started several years ago, late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home, and I was thinking.</s>
 <s id="18">And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.</s>
 <s id="19">And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.</s>
 <s id="20">And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.</s>
 <s id="21">And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) So I make other hats as well.</s>
 <s id="23">This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) It's fairly self-explanatory.</s>
 <s id="25">It physically carves out conversation space for one.</s>
 <s id="26">And when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.</s>
 <s id="28">So what happens when a person puts this thing on?</s>
 <s id="29">What kind of an experience do they have?</s>
 <s id="30">And how are they transformed by wearing it?</s>
 <s id="31">So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.</s>
 <s id="32">So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.</s>
 <s id="33">And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication.</s>
 <s id="35">And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.</s>
 <s id="36">So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions.</s>
 <s id="37">So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.</s>
 <s id="39">So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.</s>
 <s id="40">(Laughter) And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.</s>
 <s id="41">(Laughter) And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.</s>
 <s id="42">So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.</s>
 <s id="43">So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.</s>
 <s id="44">And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.</s>
 <s id="45">And I thought, "Well, hey!</s>
 <s id="46">Maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."</s>
 <s id="47">So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.</s>
 <s id="48">And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.</s>
 <s id="49">(Laughter) And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.</s>
 <s id="50">So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.</s>
 <s id="51">And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic, because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.</s>
 <s id="52">And so kind of thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course.</s>
 <s id="53">And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them, but what I'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) Because there seems to be an issue.</s>
 <s id="55">The glaciers are actually leaving us.</s>
 <s id="56">They're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether.</s>
 <s id="57">And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.</s>
 <s id="58">And this one's particularly interesting, because, of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.</s>
 <s id="59">They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.</s>
 <s id="60">And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.</s>
 <s id="61">When I meet a glacier for the very first time, what do I do?</s>
 <s id="62">There's no kind of social protocol for this.</s>
 <s id="63">I really just don't even know how to say hello.</s>
 <s id="64">Do I carve a message in the snow?</s>
 <s id="65">Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code.</s>
 <s id="66">Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.</s>
 <s id="67">But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship.</s>
 <s id="68">And I was really struck by how much it affected me.</s>
 <s id="69">This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.</s>
 <s id="70">And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.</s>
 <s id="71">(Laughter) And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.</s>
 <s id="72">And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug.</s>
 <s id="73">So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.</s>
 <s id="74">These are initial musings for this project.</s>
 <s id="75">And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.</s>
 <s id="76">And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists, technologists, scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations.</s>
 <s id="77">So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy, but I think what's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.</s>
 <s id="78">Thanks.</s>
 <s id="79">(Applause)</s>
