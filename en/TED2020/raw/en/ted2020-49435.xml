 <s id="1">I'm a lion conservationist.</s>
 <s id="2">Sounds cool, doesn't it?</s>
 <s id="3">Some people may have no idea what that means.</s>
 <s id="4">But I'm sure you've all heard about Cecil the lion.</s>
 <s id="5">[Cecil the Lion (2002-2015)] (Lion roaring) He roars no more.</s>
 <s id="6">On the second of July, 2015, his life was cut short when he was killed by a trophy hunter.</s>
 <s id="7">They say that you can become attached to the animals you study.</s>
 <s id="8">That was the case for me with Cecil the lion, having known him and studied him for three years in Hwange National Park.</s>
 <s id="9">I was heartbroken at his death.</s>
 <s id="10">But the good thing to come out of this tragedy is the attention that the story brought towards the plight of threatened wild animals.</s>
 <s id="11">After Cecil's death, I began to ask myself these questions: What if the community that lived next to Cecil the lion was involved in protecting him?</s>
 <s id="12">What if I had met Cecil when I was 10 years old, instead of 29?</s>
 <s id="13">Could I or my classmates have changed his fate?</s>
 <s id="14">Many people are working to stop lions from disappearing, but very few of these people are native to these countries or from the communities most affected.</s>
 <s id="15">But the communities that live with the lions are the ones best positioned to help lions the most.</s>
 <s id="16">Local people should be at the forefront of the solutions to the challenges facing their wildlife.</s>
 <s id="17">Sometimes, change can only come when the people most affected and impacted take charge.</s>
 <s id="18">Local communities play an important role in fighting poaching and illegal wildlife trade, which are major threats affecting lions and other wildlife.</s>
 <s id="19">Being a black African woman in the sciences, the people I meet are always curious to know if I've always wanted to be a conservationist, because they don't meet a lot of conservationists who look like me.</s>
 <s id="20">When I was growing up, I didn't even know that wildlife conservation was a career.</s>
 <s id="21">The first time I saw a wild animal in my home country was when I was 25 years old, even though lions and African wild dogs lived just a few miles away from my home.</s>
 <s id="22">This is quite common in Zimbabwe, as many people are not exposed to wildlife, even though it's part of our heritage.</s>
 <s id="23">When I was growing up, I didn't even know that lions lived in my backyard.</s>
 <s id="24">When I stepped into Sav√© Valley Conservancy on a cold winter morning 10 years ago to study African wild dogs for my master's research project, I was mesmerized by the beauty and the tranquility that surrounded me.</s>
 <s id="25">I felt like I had found my passion and my purpose in life.</s>
 <s id="26">I made a commitment that day that I was going to dedicate my life to protecting animals.</s>
 <s id="27">I think of my childhood school days in Zimbabwe and the other kids I was in school with.</s>
 <s id="28">Perhaps if we had a chance to interact with wildlife, more of my classmates would be working alongside me now.</s>
 <s id="29">Unless the local communities want to protect and coexist with wildlife, all conservation efforts might be in vain.</s>
 <s id="30">These are the communities that live with the wild animals in the same ecosystem and bear the cost of doing so.</s>
 <s id="31">If they don't have a direct connection or benefit from the animals, they have no reason to want to protect them.</s>
 <s id="32">And if local communities don't protect their wildlife, no amount of outside intervention will work.</s>
 <s id="33">So what needs to be done?</s>
 <s id="34">Conservationists must prioritize environmental education and help expand the community's skills to conserve their wildlife.</s>
 <s id="35">Schoolchildren and communities must be taken to national parks, so they get a chance to connect with the wildlife.</s>
 <s id="36">At every effort and every level, conservation must include the economies of the people who share the land with the wild animals.</s>
 <s id="37">It is also critical that local conservationists be part of every conservation effort, if we are to build trust and really embed conservation into communities.</s>
 <s id="38">As local conservationists, we face many hurdles, from outright discrimination to barriers because of cultural norms.</s>
 <s id="39">But I will not give up my efforts to bring indigenous communities to this fight for the survival of our planet.</s>
 <s id="40">I'm asking you to come and stand together with me.</s>
 <s id="41">We must actively dismantle the hurdles we have created, which are leaving indigenous populations out of conservation efforts.</s>
 <s id="42">I've dedicated my life to protecting lions.</s>
 <s id="43">And I know my neighbor would, too, if only they knew the animals that lived next door to them.</s>
 <s id="44">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="45">(Applause)</s>
