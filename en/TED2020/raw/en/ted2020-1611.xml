 <s id="1">So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.</s>
 <s id="2">Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.</s>
 <s id="3">The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.</s>
 <s id="4">So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, "Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"</s>
 <s id="5">And I sat, and I was like, "Man, I would buy that, eh?"</s>
 <s id="6">So I went home, and I did a little research, and I found some very shocking statistics.</s>
 <s id="7">Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.</s>
 <s id="8">Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa, and five million of them are in South Africa.</s>
 <s id="9">Various diseases thrive in this environment, the most drastic of which is called trachoma.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye.</s>
  <s id="10.2">Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind each and every year.</s>
  <s id="11.2">The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face: no medicine, no pills, no injections.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself, "Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need to do it to try to save the world."</s>
  <s id="12.2">(Laughter) So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone -- I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much, except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe — I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities -- I did high school science -- and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper, and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.</s>
 <s id="14">Now we need to get this thing into practice.</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">Fast forward four years later, after having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country, and — ("No more bathing!") — I can't say any more than that.</s>
  <s id="15.2">(Laughter) I had invented DryBath, the world's first bath-substituting lotion.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">(Laughter) So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had, I went to university, met a few people, got it into practice, and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market.</s>
  <s id="17.2">It's actually available on the market.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">So we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making DryBath available.</s>
 <s id="19">One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">They buy products on demand.</s>
  <s id="20.2">A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes.</s>
  <s id="20.3">They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.</s>
 <s id="22">You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.</s>
 <s id="23">And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand.</s>
 <s id="24">After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want DryBath.</s>
  <s id="25.2">(Laughter) At least once a week.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be a kid.</s>
 <s id="27">After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience.</s>
 <s id="28">DryBath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver.</s>
 <s id="29">Having put the product into practice, we are actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market, and one question I have for the audience today is, on the gravel roads of Limpopo, with an allowance of 50 rand a week, I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">What's stopping you?</s>
  <s id="30.2">(Applause) I'm not done yet.</s>
  <s id="30.3">I'm not done yet.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process, last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.</s>
 <p id="p32">
  <s id="32.1">I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade, and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this just because I didn't want to bathe.</s>
  <s id="32.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="33">(Applause.)</s>
