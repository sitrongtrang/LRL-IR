 <s id="1">When I look in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist and a future New York state senator.</s>
 <s id="2">(Cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison -- six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life.</s>
 <s id="3">But what got me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system.</s>
 <s id="4">Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole.</s>
 <s id="5">A few weeks before my release on parole, a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course being offered in the prison.</s>
 <s id="6">It was called Inside Criminal Justice.</s>
 <s id="7">That seems pretty straightforward, though, right?</s>
 <s id="8">Well, it turns out, the class would be made up of eight incarcerated men and eight assistant district attorneys.</s>
 <s id="9">Columbia University psychology professor Geraldine Downey and Manhattan Assistant DA Lucy Lang co-taught the course, and it was the first of its kind.</s>
 <s id="10">I can honestly say this wasn't how I imagined starting college.</s>
 <s id="11">My mind was blown from day one.</s>
 <s id="12">I assumed all the prosecutors in the room would be white.</s>
 <s id="13">But I remember walking into the room on the first day of class and seeing three black prosecutors and thinking to myself, "Wow, being a black prosecutor -- that's a thing!"</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) By the end of the first session, I was all in.</s>
 <s id="15">In fact, a few weeks after my release, I found myself doing something I prayed I wouldn't.</s>
 <s id="16">I walked right back into prison.</s>
 <s id="17">But thankfully, this time it was just as a student, to join my fellow classmates.</s>
 <s id="18">And this time, I got to go home when class was over.</s>
 <s id="19">In the next session, we talked about what had brought each of us to this point of our lives and into the classroom together.</s>
 <s id="20">I eventually got comfortable enough to reveal my truth to everyone in the room about where I came from.</s>
 <s id="21">I talked about how my sisters and I watched our mother suffer years of abuse at the hands of our stepfather, escaping, only to find ourselves living in a shelter.</s>
 <s id="22">I talked about how I swore an oath to my family to keep them safe.</s>
 <s id="23">I even explained how I didn't feel like a teenager at 13, but more like a soldier on a mission.</s>
 <s id="24">And like any soldier, this meant carrying an emotional burden on my shoulders, and I hate to say it, but a gun on my waist.</s>
 <s id="25">And just a few days after my 17th birthday, that mission completely failed.</s>
 <s id="26">As my sister and I were walking to the laundromat, a crowd stopped in front of us.</s>
 <s id="27">Two girls out of nowhere attacked my sister.</s>
 <s id="28">Still confused about what was happening, I tried to pull one girl away, and just as I did, I felt something brush across my face.</s>
 <s id="29">With my adrenaline rushing, I didn't realize a man had leaped out of the crowd and cut me.</s>
 <s id="30">As I felt warm blood ooze down my face, and watching him raise his knife toward me again, I turned to defend myself and pulled that gun from my waistband and squeezed the trigger.</s>
 <s id="31">Thankfully, he didn't lose his life that day.</s>
 <s id="32">My hands shaking and heart racing, I was paralyzed in fear.</s>
 <s id="33">From that moment, I felt regret that would never leave me.</s>
 <s id="34">I learned later on they attacked my sister in a case of mistaken identity, thinking she was someone else.</s>
 <s id="35">It was terrifying, but clear that I wasn't trained, nor was I qualified, to be the soldier that I thought I needed to be.</s>
 <s id="36">But in my neighborhood, I only felt safe carrying a weapon.</s>
 <s id="37">Now, back in the classroom, after hearing my story, the prosecutors could tell I never wanted to hurt anyone.</s>
 <s id="38">I just wanted us to make it home.</s>
 <s id="39">I could literally see the gradual change in each of their faces as they heard story after story from the other incarcerated men in the room.</s>
 <s id="40">Stories that have trapped many of us within the vicious cycle of incarceration, that most haven't been able to break free of.</s>
 <s id="41">And sure -- there are people who commit terrible crimes.</s>
 <s id="42">But the stories of these individuals' lives before they commit those acts were the kinds of stories these prosecutors had never heard.</s>
 <s id="43">And when it was their turn to speak -- the prosecutors -- I was surprised, too.</s>
 <s id="44">They weren't emotionless drones or robocops, preprogrammed to send people to prison.</s>
 <s id="45">They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters.</s>
 <s id="46">But most of all, they were good students.</s>
 <s id="47">They were ambitious and motivated.</s>
 <s id="48">And they believed that they could use the power of law to protect people.</s>
 <s id="49">They were on a mission that I could definitely understand.</s>
 <s id="50">Midway through the course, Nick, a fellow incarcerated student, poured out his concern that the prosecutors were tiptoeing around the racial bias and discrimination within our criminal justice system.</s>
 <s id="51">Now, if you've ever been to prison, you would know it's impossible to talk about justice reform without talking about race.</s>
 <s id="52">So we silently cheered for Nick and were eager to hear the prosecutors' response.</s>
 <s id="53">And no, I don't remember who spoke first, but when Chauncey Parker, a senior prosecutor, agreed with Nick and said he was committed to ending the mass incarceration of people of color, I believed him.</s>
 <s id="54">And I knew we were headed in the right direction.</s>
 <s id="55">We now started to move as a team.</s>
 <s id="56">We started exploring new possibilities and uncovering truths about our justice system and how real change happens for us.</s>
 <s id="57">For me, it wasn't the mandatory programs inside of the prison.</s>
 <s id="58">Instead, it was listening to the advice of elders -- men who have been sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison.</s>
 <s id="59">These men helped me reframe my mindset around manhood.</s>
 <s id="60">And they instilled in me all of their aspirations and goals, in the hopes that I would never return to prison, and that I would serve as their ambassador to the free world.</s>
 <s id="61">As I talked, I could see the lights turning on for one prosecutor, who said something I thought was obvious: that I had transformed despite my incarceration and not because of it.</s>
 <s id="62">It was clear these prosecutors hadn't thought much about what happens to us after they win a conviction.</s>
 <s id="63">But through the simple process of sitting in a classroom, these lawyers started to see that keeping us locked up didn't benefit our community or us.</s>
 <s id="64">Toward the end of the course, the prosecutors were excited, as we talked about our plans for life after being released.</s>
 <s id="65">But they hadn't realized how rough it was actually going to be.</s>
 <s id="66">I can literally still see the shock on one of the junior ADA's face when it hit her: the temporary ID given to us with our freedom displayed that we were just released from prison.</s>
 <s id="67">She hadn't imagined how many barriers this would create for us as we reenter society.</s>
 <s id="68">But I could also see her genuine empathy for the choice we had to make between coming home to a bed in a shelter or a couch in a relative's overcrowded apartment.</s>
 <s id="69">What we learned in the class worked its way into concrete policy recommendations.</s>
 <s id="70">We presented our proposals to the state Department of Corrections commissioner and to the Manhattan DA, at our graduation in a packed Columbia auditorium.</s>
 <s id="71">As a team, I couldn't have imagined a more memorable way to conclude our eight weeks together.</s>
 <s id="72">And just 10 months after coming home from prison, I again found myself in a strange room, invited by the commissioner of NYPD to share my perspective at a policing summit.</s>
 <s id="73">And while speaking, I recognized a familiar face in the audience.</s>
 <s id="74">It was the attorney who prosecuted my case.</s>
 <s id="75">Seeing him, I thought about our days in the courtroom seven years earlier, as I listened to him recommend a long prison sentence, as if my young life was meaningless and had no potential.</s>
 <s id="76">But this time, the circumstances were different.</s>
 <s id="77">I shook off my thoughts and walked over to shake his hand.</s>
 <s id="78">He looked happy to see me.</s>
 <s id="79">Surprised, but happy.</s>
 <s id="80">He acknowledged how proud he was about being in that room with me, and we began a conversation about working together to improve the conditions of our community.</s>
 <s id="81">And so today, I carry all of these experiences with me, as I develop the Justice Ambassadors Youth Council at Columbia University, bringing young New Yorkers -- some who have already spent time locked up and others who are still enrolled in high school -- together with city officials.</s>
 <s id="82">And in this classroom, everyone will brainstorm ideas about improving the lives of our city's most vulnerable youth before they get tried within the criminal justice system.</s>
 <s id="83">This is possible if we do the work.</s>
 <s id="84">Our society and justice system has convinced us that we can lock up our problems and punish our way out of social challenges.</s>
 <s id="85">But that's not real.</s>
 <s id="86">Imagine with me for a second a future where no one can become a prosecutor, a judge, a cop or even a parole officer without first sitting in a classroom to learn from and connect with the very people whose lives will be in their hands.</s>
 <s id="87">I'm doing my part to promote the power of conversations and the need for collaborations.</s>
 <s id="88">It is through education that we will arrive at a truth that is inclusive and unites us all in the pursuit of justice.</s>
 <s id="89">For me, it was a brand-new conversation and a new kind of classroom that showed me how both my mindset and our criminal justice system could be transformed.</s>
 <s id="90">They say the truth shall set you free.</s>
 <s id="91">But I believe it's education and communication.</s>
 <s id="92">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="93">(Applause)</s>
