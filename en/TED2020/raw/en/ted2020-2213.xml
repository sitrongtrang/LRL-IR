 <s id="1">Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.</s>
 <s id="2">After one trillion dollars in African development-related aid in the last 60 years, real per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.</s>
 <s id="3">Aid is not doing too well.</s>
 <s id="4">In response, the Bretton Woods institutions -- the IMF and the World Bank -- pushed for free trade not aid, yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth.</s>
 <s id="5">The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit.</s>
 <s id="6">We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) Yet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people want jobs instead.</s>
 <s id="8">My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.</s>
 <s id="9">Let's invest in building pan-African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.</s>
 <s id="10">Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98 and built it into a mobile cellular provider with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.</s>
 <s id="11">The Mo model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model, which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.</s>
 <s id="12">Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition.</s>
 <s id="13">Consider these two alternative scenarios.</s>
 <s id="14">One: You loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market.</s>
 <s id="15">Or two: You give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields 40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.</s>
 <s id="16">We invested in the second scenario, and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Muthomi to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten-free banana-based flour and baby food.</s>
 <s id="17">Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers, who have an ownership in the business.</s>
 <s id="18">Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim, which requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships, and extraordinary perseverance.</s>
 <s id="19">But why pan-African?</s>
 <s id="20">The scramble for Africa during the Berlin Conference of 1884 -- where, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations: Liberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000.</s>
 <s id="21">Pan-Africa gives you one billion people, granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments, but our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us.</s>
 <s id="22">The pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges, and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from just Kenya to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food.</s>
 <s id="23">We hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs, develop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.</s>
 <s id="24">While it's not the sexiest approach, and maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel-good as giving a woman 100 dollars to buy a goat on kiva.org, perhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses that scale pan-Africa can help change this.</s>
 <s id="25">The political freedom for which our forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom.</s>
 <s id="26">We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world-class businesses, creating indigenous wealth, providing jobs that we so desperately need, and hopefully helping achieve this.</s>
 <s id="27">Africa shall rise.</s>
 <s id="28">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="29">(Applause) Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.</s>
 <s id="30">You're making 100 percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment.</s>
 <s id="31">Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all?</s>
 <s id="32">Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.</s>
 <s id="33">Microcredit has been a great, innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.</s>
 <s id="34">But for the problems we face in Africa, when we are looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize war-torn Europe, it was not full of donations of sheep.</s>
 <s id="35">We need more than just microcredit.</s>
 <s id="36">We need more than just give 200 dollars.</s>
 <s id="37">We need to build big businesses, and we need jobs.</s>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">TR: Very good.</s>
  <s id="38.2">Thank you so much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">(Applause)</s>
