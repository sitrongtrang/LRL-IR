 <s id="2">Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">We're so excited to be here.</s>
  <s id="3.2">It's such an honor.</s>

 <s id="4">Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it.</s>
 <s id="6">We hope you guys will too.</s>
 <s id="7">This next song is an original we wrote called "Time Lapse," and it will probably live up to its name.</s>
 <s id="8">(Tuning) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) TM: Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="9">RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band.</s>
 <s id="10">On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.</s>
 <s id="11">(Applause) On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.</s>
 <s id="12">(Applause) He's also our brother.</s>
 <s id="13">And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.</s>
 <s id="14">(Applause) As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves, and we chose to play three songs in three different keys.</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">(Tuning) Yeah.</s>
  <s id="15.2">I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name "Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">So, it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping.</s>
 <s id="17">So you can probably piece the rest together.</s>
 <s id="18">TM: We can't really figure out the reason.</s>
 <s id="19">It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.</s>
