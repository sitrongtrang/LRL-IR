 <s id="1">What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars?</s>
 <s id="2">Actually, everything.</s>
 <s id="3">That crash happened due to an error in converting between two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence.</s>
 <s id="4">So what's the connection to the French Revolution?</s>
 <s id="5">Let's explain.</s>
 <s id="6">For the majority of recorded human history, units like the weight of a grain or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place.</s>
 <s id="7">And different regions didn't just use varying measurements.</s>
 <s id="8">They had completely different number systems as well.</s>
 <s id="9">By the late Middle Ages, the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful.</s>
 <s id="10">With a quarter million different units in France alone, any widespread change would require massive disruption.</s>
 <s id="11">And in 1789, that disruption came.</s>
 <s id="12">The leaders of the French Revolution didn't just overthrow the monarchy.</s>
 <s id="13">They sought to completely transform society according to the rational principles of the Enlightenment.</s>
 <s id="14">When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened to reform the system of measurements.</s>
 <s id="15">Old standards based on arbitrary authority or local traditions were replaced with mathematical and natural relationships.</s>
 <s id="16">For example, the meter, from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000 between the Equator and North Pole.</s>
 <s id="17">And the new metric system was, in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, "For all people, for all time."</s>
 <s id="18">Standardizing measurements had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well.</s>
 <s id="19">Nobles could no longer manipulate local units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect taxes more efficiently.</s>
 <s id="20">And switching to a new Republican Calendar with ten-day weeks reduced church power by eliminating Sundays.</s>
 <s id="21">Adoption of this new system wasn't easy.</s>
 <s id="22">In fact, it was a bit of a mess.</s>
 <s id="23">At first, people used new units alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar was eventually abandoned.</s>
 <s id="24">When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms.</s>
 <s id="25">But the metric system remained standard for formal use, and it spread across the continent, along with France's borders.</s>
 <s id="26">While Napoléon's empire lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer.</s>
 <s id="27">Some European countries reverted to old measurements upon independence.</s>
 <s id="28">Others realized the value of standardization in an age of international trade.</s>
 <s id="29">After Portugal and the Netherlands switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system around the world.</s>
 <s id="30">As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas and retained its traditional units.</s>
 <s id="31">But over the next two centuries, the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical.</s>
 <s id="32">However, this switch came too late for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence.</s>
 <s id="33">The United States of America stuck with the English units of its colonial past and today remains one of only three countries which haven't fully embraced the metric system.</s>
 <s id="34">Despite constant initiatives for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet and pounds more intuitive.</s>
 <s id="35">And ironically, some regard the once revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity.</s>
 <s id="36">Nevertheless, the metric system is almost universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according to its original principles.</s>
 <s id="37">For a long time, standard units were actually defined by carefully maintained physical prototypes.</s>
 <s id="38">But thanks to improving technology and precision, these objects with limited access and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards based on universal constants, like the speed of light.</s>
 <s id="39">Consistent measurements are such an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major accomplishment for humanity they've been.</s>
 <s id="40">And just as it arose from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial for the scientific revolutions to come.</s>
