 <s id="1">Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker activity with my students.</s>
 <s id="2">I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state.</s>
 <s id="3">Also, to our knowledge, we're the only high school in the world whose mascot is the Links.</s>
 <s id="4">Like, a chain.</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) And with that being our mascot, we have a statue out front of our building of four links connected like a chain.</s>
 <s id="6">And each link means something.</s>
 <s id="7">Our links stand for tradition, excellence, unity and diversity.</s>
 <s id="8">So on the first day of school, I teach my new ninth-graders about the meaning behind those links, and I give them each a slip of paper.</s>
 <s id="9">On that paper, I ask them to write something about themselves.</s>
 <s id="10">It can be something that they love, something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity.</s>
 <s id="11">And then I go around the room with a stapler, and I staple each of those slips together to make a chain.</s>
 <s id="12">And we hang that chain up in our classroom as a decoration, sure, but also as a reminder that we are all connected.</s>
 <s id="13">We are all links.</s>
 <s id="14">So what happens when one of those links feels weak?</s>
 <s id="15">And what happens when that weakness is in the person holding the stapler?</s>
 <s id="16">The person who's supposed to make those connections.</s>
 <s id="17">The teacher.</s>
 <s id="18">As teachers, we work every day to provide support socially, emotionally and academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances.</s>
 <s id="19">Like most teachers, I have students who go home every day, and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy, well-rounded meal for them.</s>
 <s id="20">They spend suppertime summarizing the story they read in ninth-grade English that day, or explaining how Newton's laws of motion work.</s>
 <s id="21">But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter or to the group home.</s>
 <s id="22">They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now.</s>
 <s id="23">They come to school with trauma, and when I go home every day, that goes home with me.</s>
 <s id="24">And see, that's the hard part about teaching.</s>
 <s id="25">It's not the grading, the lesson-planning, the meetings, though sure, those things do occupy a great deal of teachers' time and energy.</s>
 <s id="26">The tough part about teaching is all the things you can't control for your kids, all the things you can't change for them once they walk out your door.</s>
 <s id="27">And so I wonder if it's always been this way.</s>
 <s id="28">I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia, where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed.</s>
 <s id="29">We're not developing learners who are going to go out into a workforce where they'll stand on a line in a factory.</s>
 <s id="30">Rather, we're sending our kids out into a workforce where they need to be able to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve.</s>
 <s id="31">And that has caused teacher-student relationships to morph into something stronger than the giver of content and the receiver of knowledge.</s>
 <s id="32">Lectures and sitting in silent rows just doesn't cut it anymore.</s>
 <s id="33">We have to be able to build relationships with and among our students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it.</s>
 <s id="34">I think back to my second year teaching.</s>
 <s id="35">I had a student who I'll call "David."</s>
 <s id="36">And I remember feeling like I'd done a pretty good job at teaching that year: "Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher.</s>
 <s id="37">I know what I'm doing."</s>
 <s id="38">And it was on the last day of school, I told David to have a great summer.</s>
 <s id="39">And I watched him walk down the hall, and I thought to myself, I don't even know what his voice sounds like.</s>
 <s id="40">And that's when I realized I wasn't doing it right.</s>
 <s id="41">So I changed almost everything about my teaching.</s>
 <s id="42">I built in plenty of opportunities for my students to talk to me and to talk to each other, to share their writing and to verbalize their learning.</s>
 <s id="43">And it was through those conversations I began not only to know their voice but to know their pain.</s>
 <s id="44">I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that his father was undocumented and had been deported.</s>
 <s id="45">He started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again.</s>
 <s id="46">In so many ways, I felt his pain.</s>
 <s id="47">And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend.</s>
 <s id="48">And we recognize that need for police officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient.</s>
 <s id="49">But when it comes to teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging.</s>
 <s id="50">I believe it's paramount that students and teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals and all other support staff have convenient and affordable access to mental wellness supports.</s>
 <s id="51">When we are constantly serving others, often between 25 and 125 students each day, our emotional piggy banks are constantly being drawn upon.</s>
 <s id="52">After a while, it can become so depleted, that we just can't bear it anymore.</s>
 <s id="53">They call it "secondary trauma" and "compassion fatigue," the concept that we absorb the traumas our students share with us each day.</s>
 <s id="54">And after a while, our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all.</s>
 <s id="55">The Buffett Institute at the University of Nebraska recently found that most teachers -- 86 percent across early childhood settings -- experienced some depressive symptoms during the prior week.</s>
 <s id="56">They found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant depressive symptoms.</s>
 <s id="57">My interactions with colleagues and my own experiences make me feel like this is a universal struggle across all grade levels.</s>
 <s id="58">So what are we missing?</s>
 <s id="59">What are we allowing to break the chain and how do we repair it?</s>
 <s id="60">In my career, I've experienced the death by suicide of two students and one amazing teacher who loved his kids; countless students experiencing homelessness; and kids entering and exiting the justice system.</s>
 <s id="61">When these events happen, protocol is to say, "If you need someone to talk to, then ..."</s>
 <s id="62">And I say that's not enough.</s>
 <s id="63">I am so lucky.</s>
 <s id="64">I work in an amazing school with great leadership.</s>
 <s id="65">I serve a large district with so many healthy partnerships with community agencies.</s>
 <s id="66">They have provided steadily increasing numbers of school counselors and therapists and support staff to help our students.</s>
 <s id="67">They even provide staff members with access to free counseling as part of our employment plan.</s>
 <s id="68">But many small districts and even some large ones simply cannot foot the bill without aid.</s>
 <s id="69">(Exhales) Not only does every school need social and emotional support staff, trained professionals who can navigate the needs of the building -- not just the students, not just the teachers, but both -- we also need these trained professionals to intentionally seek out those closest to the trauma and check in with them.</s>
 <s id="70">Many schools are doing what they can to fill in the gaps, starting with acknowledging that the work that we do is downright hard.</s>
 <s id="71">Another school in Lincoln, Schoo Middle School, has what they call "Wellness Wednesdays."</s>
 <s id="72">They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together.</s>
 <s id="73">Zachary Elementary School in Zachary, Louisiana, has something they call a "Midweek Meetup," where they invite teachers to share lunch and to talk about the things that are going well and the things that are weighing heavy on their hearts.</s>
 <s id="74">These schools are making space for conversations that matter.</s>
 <s id="75">Finally, my friend and colleague Jen Highstreet takes five minutes out of each day to write an encouraging note to a colleague, letting them know that she sees their hard work and the heart that they share with others.</s>
 <s id="76">She knows that those five minutes can have an invaluable and powerful ripple effect across our school.</s>
 <s id="77">The chain that hangs in my classroom is more than just a decoration.</s>
 <s id="78">Those links hang over our heads for the entire four years that our students walk our halls.</s>
 <s id="79">And every year, I have seniors come back to my classroom, room 340, and they can still point out where their link hangs.</s>
 <s id="80">They remember what they wrote on it.</s>
 <s id="81">They feel connected and supported.</s>
 <s id="82">And they have hope.</s>
 <s id="83">Isn't that what we all need?</s>
 <s id="84">Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK.</s>
 <s id="85">To check in with us and remind us that we are a link.</s>
 <s id="86">Every now and then, we all just need a little help holding the stapler.</s>
 <s id="87">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="88">(Applause)</s>
