 <s id="1">Why does your mouth feel like it's on fire when you eat a spicy pepper?</s>
 <s id="2">And how do you soothe the burn?</s>
 <s id="3">Why does wasabi make your eyes water?</s>
 <s id="4">And how spicy is the spiciest spice?</s>
 <s id="5">Let's back up a bit.</s>
 <s id="6">First, what is spiciness?</s>
 <s id="7">Even though we often say that something tastes spicy, it's not actually a taste, like sweet or salty or sour.</s>
 <s id="8">Instead, what's really happening is that certain compounds in spicy foods activate the type of sensory neurons called polymodal nociceptors.</s>
 <s id="9">You have these all over your body, including your mouth and nose, and they're the same receptors that are activated by extreme heat.</s>
 <s id="10">So, when you eat a chili pepper, your mouth feels like it's burning because your brain actually thinks it's burning.</s>
 <s id="11">The opposite happens when you eat something with menthol in it.</s>
 <s id="12">The cool, minty compound is activating your cold receptors.</s>
 <s id="13">When these heat-sensitive receptors are activated, your body thinks it's in contact with a dangerous heat source and reacts accordingly.</s>
 <s id="14">This is why you start to sweat, and your heart starts beating faster.</s>
 <s id="15">The peppers have elicited the same fight-or-flight response with which your body reacts to most threats.</s>
 <s id="16">But you may have noticed that not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way.</s>
 <s id="17">And the difference lies in the types of compounds involved.</s>
 <s id="18">The capsaicin and piperine, found in black pepper and chili peppers, are made up of larger, heavier molecules called alkylamides, and those mostly stay in your mouth.</s>
 <s id="19">Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi are made up of smaller molecules, called isothiocyanates, that easily float up into your sinuses.</s>
 <s id="20">This is why chili peppers burn your mouth, and wasabi burns your nose.</s>
 <s id="21">The standard measure of a food's spiciness is its rating on the Scoville scale, which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to humans.</s>
 <s id="22">A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units, while Tabasco sauce clocks in between 1,200-2,400 units.</s>
 <s id="23">The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle, but two peppers generally come out on top: The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper.</s>
 <s id="24">These peppers measure between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in pepper spray.</s>
 <s id="25">So, why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of pain?</s>
 <s id="26">Nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers.</s>
 <s id="27">Archaeologists have found spices like mustard along with human artifacts dating as far back as 23,000 years ago.</s>
 <s id="28">But they don't know whether the spices were used for food or medication or just decoration.</s>
 <s id="29">More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot, lined with charred fish and meat, also contained mustard.</s>
 <s id="30">One theory says that humans starting adding spices to food to kill off bacteria.</s>
 <s id="31">And some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent.</s>
 <s id="32">But why we continue to subject ourselves to spicy food today is still a bit of a mystery.</s>
 <s id="33">For some people, eating spicy food is like riding rollercoasters; they enjoy the ensuing thrill, even if the immediate sensation is unpleasant.</s>
 <s id="34">Some studies have even shown that those who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline-rich activities, like gambling.</s>
 <s id="35">The taste for spicy food may even be genetic.</s>
 <s id="36">And if you're thinking about training a bit, to up your tolerance for spice, know this: According to some studies, the pain doesn't get any better.</s>
 <s id="37">You just get tougher.</s>
 <s id="38">In fact, researchers have found that people who like to eat spicy foods don't rate the burn any less painful than those who don't.</s>
 <s id="39">They just seem to like the pain more.</s>
 <s id="40">So, torment your heat receptors all you want, but remember, when it comes to spicy food, you're going to get burned.</s>
