 <s id="1">Scientists work on the boundaries of the unknown, where every new piece of knowledge forms a path into a void of uncertainty.</s>
 <s id="2">And nothing is more uncertain– or potentially enlightening– than a paradox.</s>
 <s id="3">Throughout history, paradoxes have threatened to undermine everything we know, and just as often, they’ve reshaped our understanding of the world.</s>
 <s id="4">Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in the universe threatens to unravel the fields of general relativity and quantum mechanics: the black hole information paradox.</s>
 <s id="5">To understand this paradox, we first need to define what we mean by "information."</s>
 <s id="6">Typically, the information we talk about is visible to the naked eye.</s>
 <s id="7">For example, this kind of information tells us that an apple is red, round, and shiny.</s>
 <s id="8">But physicists are more concerned with quantum information.</s>
 <s id="9">This refers to the quantum properties of all the particles that make up that apple, such as their position, velocity and spin.</s>
 <s id="10">Every object in the universe is composed of particles with unique quantum properties.</s>
 <s id="11">This idea is evoked most significantly in a vital law of physics: the total amount of quantum information in the Universe must be conserved.</s>
 <s id="12">Even if you destroy an object beyond recognition, its quantum information is never permanently deleted.</s>
 <s id="13">And theoretically, knowledge of that information would allow us to recreate the object from its particle components.</s>
 <s id="14">Conservation of information isn’t just an arbitrary rule, but a mathematical necessity, upon which much of modern science is built.</s>
 <s id="15">But around black holes, those foundations get shaken.</s>
 <s id="16">When an apple enters a black hole, it seems as though it leaves the universe, and all its quantum information becomes irretrievably lost.</s>
 <s id="17">However, this doesn’t immediately break the laws of physics.</s>
 <s id="18">The information is out of sight, but it might still exist within the black hole’s mysterious void.</s>
 <s id="19">Alternatively, some theories suggest that information doesn’t even make it inside the black hole at all.</s>
 <s id="20">Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s quantum information is encoded on the surface layer of the black hole, called the event horizon.</s>
 <s id="21">As the black hole’s mass increases, the surface of the event horizon increases as well.</s>
 <s id="22">So it’s possible that as a black hole swallows an object, it also grows large enough to conserve the object’s quantum information.</s>
 <s id="23">But whether information is conserved inside the black hole or on its surface, the laws of physics remain intact– until you account for Hawking Radiation.</s>
 <s id="24">Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974, this phenomenon shows that black holes are gradually evaporating.</s>
 <s id="25">Over incredibly long periods of time black holes lose mass as they shed particles away from their event horizons.</s>
 <s id="26">Critically, it seems as though the evaporating particles are unrelated to the information the black hole encodes– suggesting that a black hole and all the quantum information it contains could be completely erased.</s>
 <s id="27">Does that quantum information truly disappear?</s>
 <s id="28">If not, where does it go?</s>
 <s id="29">While the evaporation process would take an incredibly long time, the questions it raises for physics are far more urgent.</s>
 <s id="30">The destruction of information would force us to rewrite some of our most fundamental scientific paradigms.</s>
 <s id="31">But fortunately, in science, every paradox is an opportunity for new discoveries.</s>
 <s id="32">Researchers are investigating a broad range of possible solutions to the Information Paradox.</s>
 <s id="33">Some have theorized that information actually is encoded in the escaping radiation, in some way we can’t yet understand.</s>
 <s id="34">Others have suggested the paradox is just a misunderstanding of how general relativity and quantum field theory interact.</s>
 <s id="35">Respectively, these two theories describe the largest and smallest physical phenomena, and they’re notoriously difficult to combine.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">Some researchers argue that a solution to this and many other paradoxes will come naturally with a “unified theory of everything.”</s>
  <s id="36.2">But perhaps the most mind-bending theory to come from exploring this paradox is the holographic principle.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">Expanding on the idea that the 2D surface of an event horizon can store quantum information, this principle suggests that the very boundary of the observable universe is also a 2D surface encoded with information about real, 3D objects.</s>
 <s id="38">If this is true, it’s possible that reality as we know it is just a holographic projection of that information.</s>
 <s id="39">If proven, any of these theories would open up new questions to explore, while still preserving our current models of the universe.</s>
 <s id="40">But it’s also possible that those models are wrong!</s>
 <s id="41">Either way, this paradox has already helped us take another step into the unknown.</s>
