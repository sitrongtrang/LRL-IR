 <s id="1">What if you could make your sleep more efficient?</s>
 <s id="2">As a sleep scientist, this is the question that has captivated me for the past 10 years.</s>
 <s id="3">Because while the lightbulb and technology have brought about a world of 24-hour work and productivity, it has come at the cost of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm and our body's need for sleep.</s>
 <s id="4">The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day, and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm, which is putting our sleep health and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy.</s>
 <s id="5">Because of this, we aren't getting the sleep we need, with the average American sleeping a whole hour less than they did in the 1940s.</s>
 <s id="6">For some reason, we decided to wear it as a badge of honor that we can get by on not enough sleep.</s>
 <s id="7">This all adds up to a real health crisis.</s>
 <s id="8">Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes.</s>
 <s id="9">And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, you're more likely to get many of these illnesses.</s>
 <s id="10">But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states?</s>
 <s id="11">Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions and is a drain on our capacity for empathy.</s>
 <s id="12">When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain, it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others and just generally being a good and healthy person when we're sleep-deprived.</s>
 <s id="13">Scientists are now starting to understand how not only the quantity but also the quality of sleep impacts our health and well-being.</s>
 <s id="14">My research focuses on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep: deep sleep.</s>
 <s id="15">We now know that generally speaking, there are three stages of sleep: light sleep, rapid eye movement or REM and deep sleep.</s>
 <s id="16">We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.</s>
 <s id="17">In light sleep and REM, our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life.</s>
 <s id="18">But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves that are very different from our waking life brain waves.</s>
 <s id="19">These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves.</s>
 <s id="20">When we don't get the deep sleep we need, it inhibits our ability to learn and for our cells and bodies to recover.</s>
 <s id="21">Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions that we make during the day into our long-term memory and personalities.</s>
 <s id="22">As we get older, we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves.</s>
 <s id="23">So in way, deep sleep and delta waves are actually a marker for biological youth.</s>
 <s id="24">So naturally, I wanted to get more deep sleep for myself and I literally tried almost every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there -- consumer-grade, clinical-grade, what have you.</s>
 <s id="25">I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people, eight hours of sleep.</s>
 <s id="26">I even shifted my circadian component by changing my meals, exercise and light exposure, but I still couldn't find a way to get a deeper night of sleep ...</s>
 <s id="27">that is until I met Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko from Harvard Medical School.</s>
 <s id="28">Dmitry told me about a new finding in the literature, where a lab out of Germany showed that if you could play certain sounds at the right time in people's sleep, you could actually make sleep deeper and more efficient.</s>
 <s id="29">And what's more, is that this lab showed that you actually could improve next-day memory performance with this sound.</s>
 <s id="30">Dmitry and I teamed up, and we began working on a way to build this technology.</s>
 <s id="31">With our research lab collaborators at Penn State, we designed experiments in order to validate our system.</s>
 <s id="32">And we've since received grant funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health to develop this deep-sleep stimulating technology.</s>
 <s id="33">Here's how it works.</s>
 <s id="34">People came into the lab and we hooked them up to a number of devices, two of which I have on right here -- not a fashion statement.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) When we detected that people were in deep sleep, we played the deep-sleep stimulating sounds that were shown to make them have deeper sleep.</s>
 <s id="36">I'm going to demo this sound for you right now.</s>
 <s id="37">(Repeating sound waves) Pretty weird, right?</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) So that sound is actually at the same burst frequency as your brain waves when your brain is in deep sleep.</s>
 <s id="39">That sound pattern actually primes your mind to have more of these regenerative delta waves.</s>
 <s id="40">When we asked participants the next day about the sounds, they were completely unaware that we played the sounds, yet their brains responded with more of these delta waves.</s>
 <s id="41">Here's an image of someone's brain waves from the study that we conducted.</s>
 <s id="42">See the bottom panel?</s>
 <s id="43">This shows the sound being played at that burst frequency.</s>
 <s id="44">Now look at the brain waves in the upper part of the graph.</s>
 <s id="45">You can see from the graph that the sound is actually producing more of these regenerative delta waves.</s>
 <s id="46">We learned that we could accurately track sleep without hooking people up to electrodes and make people sleep deeper.</s>
 <s id="47">We're continuing to develop the right sound environment and sleep habitat to improve people's sleep health.</s>
 <s id="48">Our sleep isn't as regenerative as it could be, but maybe one day soon, we could wear a small device and get more out of our sleep.</s>
 <s id="49">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="50">(Applause)</s>
