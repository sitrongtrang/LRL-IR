 <s id="1">So I work in marketing, which I love, but my first passion was physics, a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher, when I had a little less gray hair.</s>
 <s id="2">So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.</s>
 <s id="3">And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.</s>
 <s id="4">So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university?</s>
 <s id="5">Who studied some physics in university?</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">Pretty good.</s>
  <s id="6.2">And at school?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">Okay, lots of you.</s>
 <s id="8">So, hopefully this will bring back some happy, or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.</s>
 <s id="9">So, physics and marketing.</s>
 <s id="10">We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration."</s>
 <s id="11">This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign.</s>
 <s id="12">(Laughter) But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.</s>
 <s id="13">It's the same with brands: the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.</s>
 <s id="14">And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy.</s>
 <s id="15">It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners, and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;amp;G keep brands separate, like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand.</s>
 <s id="16">So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction.</s>
 <s id="17">The marketing is, the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.</s>
 <s id="18">So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.</s>
 <s id="19">Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?</s>
 <s id="20">Getting a little more technical now.</s>
 <s id="21">So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.</s>
 <s id="22">So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.</s>
 <s id="23">By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.</s>
 <s id="24">The act of observation changes it.</s>
 <s id="25">It's the same in marketing.</s>
 <s id="26">So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.</s>
 <s id="27">Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group, and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.</s>
 <s id="28">And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.</s>
 <s id="29">Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit, but don't shop like that any other day.</s>
 <s id="30">And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web, it's very few.</s>
 <s id="31">Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.</s>
 <s id="32">So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.</s>
 <s id="33">Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.</s>
 <s id="34">So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.</s>
 <s id="35">The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.</s>
 <s id="36">So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.</s>
 <s id="37">What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning, and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.</s>
 <s id="38">And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.</s>
 <s id="39">So if we take an example -- Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth.</s>
 <s id="40">It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water.</s>
 <s id="41">And there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers' belief.</s>
 <s id="42">Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand, but then one little accident.</s>
 <s id="43">Think about Toyota.</s>
 <s id="44">It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.</s>
 <s id="45">And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.</s>
 <s id="46">Well, you know the story.</s>
 <s id="47">(Laughter) So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky.</s>
 <s id="48">And the marketing is that not matter how much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work.</s>
 <s id="49">So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand.</s>
 <s id="50">And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics.</s>
 <s id="51">This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.</s>
 <s id="52">The same is true of marketing.</s>
 <s id="53">If we go back 20 years, the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.</s>
 <s id="54">But where we are today, things have changed.</s>
 <s id="55">You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster.</s>
 <s id="56">But then you lose control of it.</s>
 <s id="57">With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes.</s>
 <s id="58">Your brand starts being dispersed, (Laughter) it gets more chaotic.</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) It's out of your control.</s>
 <s id="60">(Laughter) I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.</s>
 <s id="61">But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing.</s>
 <s id="62">This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.</s>
 <s id="63">It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force, which is ultimately good for your brand.</s>
 <s id="64">So, the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.</s>
 <s id="65">The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.</s>
 <s id="66">You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it.</s>
 <s id="67">So to close, my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me that physics is cool, and hopefully, I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.</s>
 <s id="68">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="69">(Applause)</s>
