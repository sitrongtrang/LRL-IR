 <s id="1">When a team of archaeologists recently came across some 15,000 year-old human remains, they made an interesting discovery.</s>
 <s id="2">The teeth of those ancient humans were riddled with holes.</s>
 <s id="3">Their cavities were caused by the same thing that still plagues us today, specific tiny microbes that live in our mouths.</s>
 <s id="4">These microbes are with us soon after birth.</s>
 <s id="5">We typically pick them up as babies from our mothers' mouths.</s>
 <s id="6">And as our teeth erupt, they naturally begin to accumulate communities of bacteria.</s>
 <s id="7">Depending on what we eat, and specifically how much sugar we consume, certain microbes can overpopulate and cause cavities.</s>
 <s id="8">Diets high in sugary foods cause an explosion of bacteria called mutans streptococci in our mouths.</s>
 <s id="9">Like humans, these microorganisms love sugar, using it as a molecular building block and energy source.</s>
 <s id="10">As they consume it, the bacteria generate byproducts in the form of acids, such as lactic acid.</s>
 <s id="11">Mutans streptococci are resistant to this acid, but unfortunately, our teeth aren't.</s>
 <s id="12">While each human tooth is coated in a hardy, protective layer of enamel, it's no match for acid.</s>
 <s id="13">That degrades the armor over time, leaching away its calcium minerals.</s>
 <s id="14">Gradually, acid wears down a pathway for bacteria into the tooth's secondary layer called the dentin.</s>
 <s id="15">Since blood vessels and nerves in our teeth are enclosed deep within, at this stage, the expanding cavity doesn't hurt.</s>
 <s id="16">But if the damage extends beyond the dentin, the bacterial invasion progresses causing excruciating pain as the nerves become exposed.</s>
 <s id="17">Without treatment, the whole tooth may become infected and require removal all due to those sugar-loving bacteria.</s>
 <s id="18">The more sugar our food contains, the more our teeth are put at risk.</s>
 <s id="19">Those cavemen would hardly have indulged in sugary treats, however, so what caused their cavities?</s>
 <s id="20">In meat-heavy diets, there would have been a low-risk of cavities developing because lean meat contains very little sugar, but that's not all our early human ancestors ate.</s>
 <s id="21">Cavemen would also have consumed root vegetables, nuts, and grains, all of which contain carbohydrates.</s>
 <s id="22">When exposed to enzymes in the saliva, carbohydrates get broken down into simpler sugars, which can become the fodder for those ravenous mouth bacteria.</s>
 <s id="23">So while ancient humans did eat less sugar compared to us, their teeth were still exposed to sugars.</s>
 <s id="24">That doesn't mean they were unable to treat their cavities, though.</s>
 <s id="25">Archaeological remains show that about 14,000 years ago, humans were already using sharpened flint to remove bits of rotten teeth.</s>
 <s id="26">Ancient humans even made rudimentary drills to smooth out the rough holes left behind and beeswax to plug cavities, like modern-day fillings.</s>
 <s id="27">Today, we have much more sophisticated techniques and tools, which is fortunate because we also need to contend with our more damaging, sugar-guzzling ways.</s>
 <s id="28">After the Industrial Revolution, the human incidence of cavities surged because suddenly we had technological advances that made refined sugar cheaper and accessible.</s>
 <s id="29">Today, an incredible 92% of American adults have had cavities in their teeth.</s>
 <s id="30">Some people are more susceptible to cavities due to genes that may cause certain weaknesses, like softer enamel, but for most, high sugar consumption is to blame.</s>
 <s id="31">However, we have developed other ways of minimizing cavities besides reducing our intake of sugar and starch.</s>
 <s id="32">In most toothpastes and many water supplies, we use tiny amounts of fluoride.</s>
 <s id="33">That strengthens teeth and encourages the growth of enamel crystals that build up a tooth's defenses against acid.</s>
 <s id="34">When cavities do develop, we use tooth fillings to fill and close off the infected area, preventing them from getting worse.</s>
 <s id="35">The best way to avoid a cavity is still cutting down on sugar intake and practicing good oral hygiene to get rid of the bacteria and their food sources.</s>
 <s id="36">That includes regular tooth brushing, flossing, and avoiding sugary, starchy, and sticky foods that cling to your teeth between meals.</s>
 <s id="37">Gradually, the population of sugar-loving microbes in your mouth will decline.</s>
 <s id="38">Unlike the cavemen of yesteryear, today we have the knowledge required to avert a cavity calamity.</s>
 <s id="39">We just need to use it.</s>
