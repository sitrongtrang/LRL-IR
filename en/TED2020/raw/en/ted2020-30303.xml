 <s id="1">From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creatures on earth, every living thing is defined by its genes.</s>
 <s id="2">The DNA contained in our genes acts like an instruction manual for our cells.</s>
 <s id="3">Four building blocks called bases are strung together in precise sequences, which tell the cell how to behave and form the basis for our every trait.</s>
 <s id="4">But with recent advancements in gene editing tools, scientists can change an organism’s fundamental features in record time.</s>
 <s id="5">They can engineer drought-resistant crops and create apples that don’t brown.</s>
 <s id="6">They might even prevent the spread of infectious outbreaks and develop cures for genetic diseases.</s>
 <s id="7">CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and cheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science.</s>
 <s id="8">But where did this medical marvel come from?</s>
 <s id="9">How does it work?</s>
 <s id="10">And what can it do?</s>
 <s id="11">Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a natural process that’s long functioned as a bacterial immune system.</s>
 <s id="12">Originally found defending single-celled bacteria and archaea against invading viruses, naturally occurring CRISPR uses two main components.</s>
 <s id="13">The first are short snippets of repetitive DNA sequences called “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” or simply, CRISPRs.</s>
 <s id="14">The second are Cas, or “CRISPR-associated” proteins which chop up DNA like molecular scissors.</s>
 <s id="15">When a virus invades a bacterium, Cas proteins cut out a segment of the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium’s CRISPR region, capturing a chemical snapshot of the infection.</s>
 <s id="16">Those viral codes are then copied into short pieces of RNA.</s>
 <s id="17">This molecule plays many roles in our cells, but in the case of CRISPR, RNA binds to a special protein called Cas9.</s>
 <s id="18">The resulting complexes act like scouts, latching onto free-floating genetic material and searching for a match to the virus.</s>
 <s id="19">If the virus invades again, the scout complex recognizes it immediately, and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA.</s>
 <s id="20">Lots of bacteria have this type of defense mechanism.</s>
 <s id="21">But in 2012, scientists figured out how to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA, but any DNA in almost any organism.</s>
 <s id="22">With the right tools, this viral immune system becomes a precise gene-editing tool, which can alter DNA and change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo.</s>
 <s id="23">Here’s how it works in the lab: scientists design a “guide” RNA to match the gene they want to edit, and attach it to Cas9.</s>
 <s id="24">Like the viral RNA in the CRISPR immune system, the guide RNA directs Cas9 to the target gene, and the protein’s molecular scissors snip the DNA.</s>
 <s id="25">This is the key to CRISPR’s power: just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short piece of custom guide RNA scientists can edit practically any gene in the genome.</s>
 <s id="26">Once the DNA is cut, the cell will try to repair it.</s>
 <s id="27">Typically, proteins called nucleases trim the broken ends and join them back together.</s>
 <s id="28">But this type of repair process, called nonhomologous end joining, is prone to mistakes and can lead to extra or missing bases.</s>
 <s id="29">The resulting gene is often unusable and turned off.</s>
 <s id="30">However, if scientists add a separate sequence of template DNA to their CRISPR cocktail, cellular proteins can perform a different DNA repair process, called homology directed repair.</s>
 <s id="31">This template DNA is used as a blueprint to guide the rebuilding process, repairing a defective gene or even inserting a completely new one.</s>
 <s id="32">The ability to fix DNA errors means that CRISPR could potentially create new treatments for diseases linked to specific genetic errors, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.</s>
 <s id="33">And since it’s not limited to humans, the applications are almost endless.</s>
 <s id="34">CRISPR could create plants that yield larger fruit, mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria, or even reprogram drug-resistant cancer cells.</s>
 <s id="35">It’s also a powerful tool for studying the genome, allowing scientists to watch what happens when genes are turned off or changed within an organism.</s>
 <s id="36">CRISPR isn’t perfect yet.</s>
 <s id="37">It doesn’t always make just the intended changes, and since it’s difficult to predict the long-term implications of a CRISPR edit, this technology raises big ethical questions.</s>
 <s id="38">It’s up to us to decide the best course forward as CRISPR leaves single-celled organisms behind and heads into labs, farms, hospitals, and organisms around the world.</s>
