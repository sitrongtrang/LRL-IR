 <s id="1">Imagine, for a second, a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple.</s>
 <s id="2">You probably haven't actually seen any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly.</s>
 <s id="3">How does your brain produce an image of something you've never seen?</s>
 <s id="4">That may not seem hard, but that's only because we're so used to doing it.</s>
 <s id="5">It turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain.</s>
 <s id="6">That's because to create these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made from fragments of photos.</s>
 <s id="7">The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands of electrical signals getting them all to their destination at precisely the right time.</s>
 <s id="8">When you look at an object, thousands of neurons in your posterior cortex fire.</s>
 <s id="9">These neurons encode various characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow.</s>
 <s id="10">This synchronous firing strengthens the connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple.</s>
 <s id="11">In neuroscience, this is called the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together.</s>
 <s id="12">If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up, assembling a complete mental image.</s>
 <s id="13">Dolphins are encoded by a different neuronal ensemble.</s>
 <s id="14">In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble associated with it, the neurons wired together by that synchronized firing.</s>
 <s id="15">But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them.</s>
 <s id="16">The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn't exist.</s>
 <s id="17">So how come you can imagine it anyway?</s>
 <s id="18">One hypothesis, called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key.</s>
 <s id="19">If the neuronal ensembles for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image.</s>
 <s id="20">But something in your brain has to coordinate that firing.</s>
 <s id="21">One plausible candidate is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in all complex cognitive functions.</s>
 <s id="22">Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions called neural fibers.</s>
 <s id="23">The mental synthesis theory proposes that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles in the posterior cortex.</s>
 <s id="24">This activates them in unison.</s>
 <s id="25">If the neuronal ensembles are turned on at the same time, you experience the composite image just as if you'd actually seen it.</s>
 <s id="26">This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis.</s>
 <s id="27">In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both neuronal ensembles at the same time.</s>
 <s id="28">The problem is that some neurons are much farther away from the prefrontal cortex than others.</s>
 <s id="29">If the signals travel down both fibers at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync.</s>
 <s id="30">You can't change the length of the connections, but your brain, especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change the conduction velocity.</s>
 <s id="31">Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin.</s>
 <s id="32">Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals zipping down the nerve fiber.</s>
 <s id="33">Some neural fibers have as many as 100 layers of myelin.</s>
 <s id="34">Others only have a few.</s>
 <s id="35">And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones.</s>
 <s id="36">Some scientists now think that this difference in myelination could be the key to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, to our mental synthesis ability.</s>
 <s id="37">A lot of this myelination happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies throughout our lives.</s>
