 <s id="1">You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.</s>
 <s id="2">Obviously, that's changed, but only recently.</s>
 <s id="3">It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk, at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" -- 1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30.</s>
 <s id="4">That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14, and the youngest, just four.</s>
 <s id="5">I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs.</s>
 <s id="6">Yes, I'm in rap songs.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) Almost 40 rap songs.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) But the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened.</s>
 <s id="9">At the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy.</s>
 <s id="10">(Laughter) I know, right?</s>
 <s id="11">He was charming, and I was flattered, and I declined.</s>
 <s id="12">You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?</s>
 <s id="13">He could make me feel 22 again.</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) (Applause) I realized, later that night, I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) (Applause) At the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss.</s>
 <s id="16">And at the age of 24, I learned the devastating consequences.</s>
 <s id="17">Can I see a show of hands of anyone here who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22?</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">Yep.</s>
  <s id="18.2">That's what I thought.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">So like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person, maybe even your boss.</s>
 <s id="20">Unlike me, though, your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) Of course, life is full of surprises.</s>
 <s id="22">Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake, and I regret that mistake deeply.</s>
 <s id="23">In 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance, I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before.</s>
 <s id="24">Remember, just a few years earlier, news was consumed from just three places: reading a newspaper or magazine, listening to the radio or watching television.</s>
 <s id="25">That was it.</s>
 <s id="26">But that wasn't my fate.</s>
 <s id="27">Instead, this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution.</s>
 <s id="28">That meant we could access all the information we wanted, when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere.</s>
 <s id="29">And when the story broke in January 1998, it broke online.</s>
 <s id="30">It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story -- a click that reverberated around the world.</s>
 <s id="31">What that meant for me personally was that overnight, I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.</s>
 <s id="32">I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale almost instantaneously.</s>
 <s id="33">This rush to judgment, enabled by technology, led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.</s>
 <s id="34">Granted, it was before social media, but people could still comment online, e-mail stories, and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.</s>
 <s id="35">News sources plastered photos of me all over to sell newspapers, banner ads online, and to keep people tuned to the TV.</s>
 <s id="36">Do you recall a particular image of me, say, wearing a beret?</s>
 <s id="37">Now, I admit I made mistakes -- especially wearing that beret.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) But the attention and judgment that I received -- not the story, but that I personally received -- was unprecedented.</s>
 <s id="39">I was branded as a tramp, tart, slut, whore, bimbo, and, of course, "that woman."</s>
 <s id="40">I was seen by many, but actually known by few.</s>
 <s id="41">And I get it: it was easy to forget that that woman was dimensional, had a soul and was once unbroken.</s>
 <s id="42">When this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it.</s>
 <s id="43">Now we call it "cyberbullying" and "online harassment."</s>
 <s id="44">Today, I want to share some of my experience with you, talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations, and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change that results in less suffering for others.</s>
 <s id="45">In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity.</s>
 <s id="46">I lost almost everything.</s>
 <s id="47">And I almost lost my life.</s>
 <s id="48">Let me paint a picture for you.</s>
 <s id="49">It is September of 1998.</s>
 <s id="50">I'm sitting in a windowless office room inside the Office of the Independent Counsel, underneath humming fluorescent lights.</s>
 <s id="51">I'm listening to the sound of my voice, my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls that a supposed friend had made the year before.</s>
 <s id="52">I'm here because I've been legally required to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation.</s>
 <s id="53">For the past eight months, the mysterious content of these tapes has hung like the sword of Damocles over my head.</s>
 <s id="54">I mean, who can remember what they said a year ago?</s>
 <s id="55">Scared and mortified, I listen, listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day; listen as I confess my love for the president, and, of course, my heartbreak; listen to my sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth; listen, deeply, deeply ashamed, to the worst version of myself, a self I don't even recognize.</s>
 <s id="56">A few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress, and all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.</s>
 <s id="57">That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough.</s>
 <s id="58">But a few weeks later, the audiotapes are aired on TV, and significant portions made available online.</s>
 <s id="59">The public humiliation was excruciating.</s>
 <s id="60">Life was almost unbearable.</s>
 <s id="61">This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998, and by "this," I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions, conversations or photos, and then making them public -- public without consent, public without context and public without compassion.</s>
 <s id="62">Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010, and now social media has been born.</s>
 <s id="63">The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine, whether or not someone actually made a mistake, and now, it's for both public and private people.</s>
 <s id="64">The consequences for some have become dire, very dire.</s>
 <s id="65">I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010, and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman from Rutgers University, named Tyler Clementi.</s>
 <s id="66">Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate while being intimate with another man.</s>
 <s id="67">When the online world learned of this incident, the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.</s>
 <s id="68">A few days later, Tyler jumped from the George Washington Bridge to his death.</s>
 <s id="69">He was 18.</s>
 <s id="70">My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family, and she was gutted with pain in a way that I just couldn't quite understand.</s>
 <s id="71">And then eventually, I realized she was reliving 1998, reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night, reliving -- (Chokes up) sorry -- reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open, and reliving a time when both of my parents feared that I would be humiliated to death, literally.</s>
 <s id="72">Today, too many parents haven't had the chance to step in and rescue their loved ones.</s>
 <s id="73">Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation after it was too late.</s>
 <s id="74">Tyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me.</s>
 <s id="75">It served to recontextualize my experiences, and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different.</s>
 <s id="76">In 1998, we had no way of knowing where this brave new technology called the internet would take us.</s>
 <s id="77">Since then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways -- joining lost siblings, saving lives, launching revolutions ...</s>
 <s id="78">But the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced had mushroomed.</s>
 <s id="79">Every day online, people -- especially young people, who are not developmentally equipped to handle this -- are so abused and humiliated that they can't imagine living to the next day.</s>
 <s id="80">And some, tragically, don't.</s>
 <s id="81">And there's nothing virtual about that.</s>
 <s id="82">Childline, a UK nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues, released a staggering statistic late last year: from 2012 to 2013, there was an 87 percent increase in calls and e-mails related to cyberbullying.</s>
 <s id="83">A meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands showed that for the first time, cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying.</s>
 <s id="84">And you know, what shocked me -- although it shouldn't have -- was other research last year that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion than either happiness or even anger.</s>
 <s id="85">Cruelty to others is nothing new.</s>
 <s id="86">But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified, uncontained and permanently accessible.</s>
 <s id="87">The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village, school or community.</s>
 <s id="88">But now, it's the online community too.</s>
 <s id="89">Millions of people, often anonymously, can stab you with their words, and that's a lot of pain.</s>
 <s id="90">And there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade.</s>
 <s id="91">There is a very personal price to public humiliation, and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price.</s>
 <s id="92">For nearly two decades now, we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation in our cultural soil, both on- and offline.</s>
 <s id="93">Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics, news outlets and sometimes hackers all traffic in shame.</s>
 <s id="94">It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online, which lends itself to trolling, invasion of privacy and cyberbullying.</s>
 <s id="95">This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls "a culture of humiliation."</s>
 <s id="96">Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone.</s>
 <s id="97">Snapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations and claims that its messages only have the life span of a few seconds.</s>
 <s id="98">You can imagine the range of content that that gets.</s>
 <s id="99">A third-party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the life span of the messages was hacked, and 100,000 personal conversations, photos and videos were leaked online, to now have a life span of forever.</s>
 <s id="100">Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked, and private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission.</s>
 <s id="101">One gossip website had over five million hits for this one story.</s>
 <s id="102">And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?</s>
 <s id="103">The documents which received the most attention were private e-mails that had maximum public embarrassment value.</s>
 <s id="104">But in this culture of humiliation, there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming.</s>
 <s id="105">The price does not measure the cost to the victim, which Tyler and too many others -- notably, women, minorities and members of the LGBTQ community -- have paid, but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them.</s>
 <s id="106">This invasion of others is a raw material, efficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit.</s>
 <s id="107">A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry.</s>
 <s id="108">How is the money made?</s>
 <s id="109">Clicks.</s>
 <s id="110">The more shame, the more clicks.</s>
 <s id="111">The more clicks, the more advertising dollars.</s>
 <s id="112">We're in a dangerous cycle.</s>
 <s id="113">The more we click on this kind of gossip, the more numb we get to the human lives behind it.</s>
 <s id="114">And the more numb we get, the more we click.</s>
 <s id="115">All the while, someone is making money off of the back of someone else's suffering.</s>
 <s id="116">With every click, we make a choice.</s>
 <s id="117">The more we saturate our culture with public shaming, the more accepted it is, the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying, trolling, some forms of hacking and online harassment.</s>
 <p id="p118">
  <s id="118.1">Why?</s>
  <s id="118.2">Because they all have humiliation at their cores.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="119">This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created.</s>
 <s id="120">Just think about it.</s>
 <s id="121">Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs.</s>
 <s id="122">We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia and plenty of other biases, today and in the past.</s>
 <s id="123">As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage, more people have been offered equal freedoms.</s>
 <s id="124">When we began valuing sustainability, more people began to recycle.</s>
 <s id="125">So as far as our culture of humiliation goes, what we need is a cultural revolution.</s>
 <s id="126">Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop, and it's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture.</s>
 <s id="127">The shift begins with something simple, but it's not easy.</s>
 <s id="128">We need to return to a long-held value of compassion, compassion and empathy.</s>
 <s id="129">Online, we've got a compassion deficit, an empathy crisis.</s>
 <s id="130">Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote, "Shame can't survive empathy."</s>
 <s id="131">Shame cannot survive empathy.</s>
 <s id="132">I've seen some very dark days in my life.</s>
 <s id="133">It was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me.</s>
 <s id="134">Even empathy from one person can make a difference.</s>
 <s id="135">The theory of minority influence, proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici, says that even in small numbers, when there's consistency over time, change can happen.</s>
 <s id="136">In the online world, we can foster minority influence by becoming upstanders.</s>
 <s id="137">To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy, we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation.</s>
 <s id="138">Trust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity.</s>
 <s id="139">We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations that deal with these kinds of issues, like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the US; in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro; and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT.</s>
 <s id="140">We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression.</s>
 <s id="141">But we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of expression.</s>
 <s id="142">We all want to be heard, but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention and speaking up for attention.</s>
 <s id="143">The internet is the superhighway for the id.</s>
 <s id="144">But online, showing empathy to others benefits us all and helps create a safer and better world.</s>
 <s id="145">We need to communicate online with compassion, consume news with compassion and click with compassion.</s>
 <s id="146">Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.</s>
 <s id="147">I'd like to end on a personal note.</s>
 <s id="148">In the past nine months, the question I've been asked the most is "Why?"</s>
 <s id="149">Why now?</s>
 <s id="150">Why was I sticking my head above the parapet?</s>
 <s id="151">You can read between the lines in those questions, and the answer has nothing to do with politics.</s>
 <s id="152">The top-note answer was and is "Because it's time."</s>
 <s id="153">Time to stop tiptoeing around my past, time to stop living a life of opprobrium and time to take back my narrative.</s>
 <s id="154">It's also not just about saving myself.</s>
 <s id="155">Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation needs to know one thing: You can survive it.</s>
 <s id="156">I know it's hard.</s>
 <s id="157">It may not be painless, quick or easy, but you can insist on a different ending to your story.</s>
 <s id="158">Have compassion for yourself.</s>
 <s id="159">We all deserve compassion and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.</s>
 <s id="160">Thank you for listening.</s>
 <s id="161">(Applause and cheers)</s>
