 <s id="1">This syringe contains a radioactive form of glucose known as FDG.</s>
 <s id="2">The doctor will soon inject its contents into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer using a PET scanner.</s>
 <s id="3">The FDG will quickly circulate through his body.</s>
 <s id="4">If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon for the scanner.</s>
 <s id="5">PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools in medical diagnostics, and their life begins in a particle accelerator, just hours earlier.</s>
 <s id="6">The particle accelerator in question is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker within hospitals.</s>
 <s id="7">It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles like protons faster and faster along a spiraling path.</s>
 <s id="8">When the protons reach their maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen-18.</s>
 <s id="9">When a proton slams into one of these heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle called a neutron.</s>
 <s id="10">This impact turns oxygen-18 into fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be detected on a PET scan.</s>
 <s id="11">In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking to get the scan done.</s>
 <s id="12">So how can fluorine-18 be used to detect diseases?</s>
 <s id="13">Radiochemists at the hospital can use a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine to different molecules, creating radiotracers.</s>
 <s id="14">The identity of the tracer depends on what doctors want to observe.</s>
 <s id="15">FDG is a common one because the rate at which cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia.</s>
 <s id="16">The FDG is now ready for the patient’s scan.</s>
 <s id="17">When a radiolabeled tracer enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system and gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain, cancer cells, or otherwise.</s>
 <s id="18">Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has found its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation.</s>
 <s id="19">Now the doctors can see their target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner.</s>
 <s id="20">The radiation that the tracer emits is what makes this possible.</s>
 <s id="21">The isotopes used in PET decay by positron emission.</s>
 <s id="22">Positrons are essentially electrons with positive charge.</s>
 <s id="23">When emitted, a positron collides with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings.</s>
 <s id="24">This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is converted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions.</s>
 <s id="25">These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls.</s>
 <s id="26">The software in the scanner uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body the collision occurred and create a 3D map of the tracer’s distribution.</s>
 <s id="27">PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of imaging.</s>
 <s id="28">They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that otherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy.</s>
 <s id="29">Meanwhile, researchers are actively working to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for.</s>
 <s id="30">But with all this talk of radiation and nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe?</s>
 <s id="31">Even though no amount of ionizing radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives during a PET scan is actually quite low.</s>
 <s id="32">One scan is comparable to what you’re exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, like radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 20 to 30 transatlantic flights.</s>
 <s id="33">Most patients feel that those risks are acceptable for the chance to diagnose and treat their illnesses.</s>
