  <s id="1.1">Why grow homes?</s>
  <s id="1.2">Because we can.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.</s>
 <s id="3">And there's a cause for that, all right.</s>
 <s id="4">We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.</s>
 <s id="5">As an architect, I have to confront something like this.</s>
 <s id="6">So what's a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses?</s>
 <s id="7">Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.</s>
 <s id="8">It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together, or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.</s>
 <s id="9">And we do something different than what we did in the past; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.</s>
 <s id="10">We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter, plants, into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">It fits into the environment.</s>
  <s id="11.2">It is the environment.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">It is the landscape, right?</s>
 <s id="13">And you can have a hundred million of these homes, and it's great because they suck carbon.</s>
 <s id="14">They're perfect.</s>
 <s id="15">You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs, because these are homes that are a part of the environment.</s>
 <s id="16">Imagine pre-growing a village -- it takes about seven to 10 years -- and everything is green.</s>
 <s id="17">So not only do we do the veggie house, we also do the in-vitro meat habitat, or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn, where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one.</s>
 <s id="18">So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.</s>
 <s id="19">And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs.</s>
 <s id="20">We use a modified inkjet printer, and we print geometry.</s>
 <s id="21">We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like, you know, shoes, leather belts, handbags, etc., where no sentient creature is harmed.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">It's victimless.</s>
  <s id="22.2">It's meat from a test tube.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes.</s>
 <s id="24">So here is a typical stud wall, an architectural construction, and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house, where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation, cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.</s>
 <s id="25">(Laughter) And we know it's incredibly ugly.</s>
 <s id="26">It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial, but we kind of chose this shape.</s>
 <s id="27">And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.</s>
 <s id="28">We had a big show in Prague, and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">That's why we grow homes.</s>
  <s id="29.2">Thanks very much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">(Applause)</s>
