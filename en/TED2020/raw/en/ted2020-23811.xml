 <s id="1">Once upon a time in the magical and very round Land of Pi, there lived six swashbuckling musketeers.</s>
 <s id="2">There names were Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.</s>
 <s id="3">But each was known best by his or her mark: the two hands ready to catch a fly of Parentheses, the small and raised digits of Exponents, the mighty X of Multiplication, slash of Division, plus of Addition, and, well, you can guess the symbol by which little Subtraction was best known.</s>
 <s id="4">The Land of Pi was not necessarily the most peaceful place, and that's why the numbers of the kingdom needed the musketeers.</s>
 <s id="5">The Land of Pi had been ruled by the numbers as anarcho-syndicalist commune, each number with a vote, but, one powerful number from what we'll call the Imperial Senate, engineered a war between some robot things and the knights of the kingdom, and then installed himself as Supreme Emperor, and then Puff the Magic Digit Dragon ate him, and a princess or two, and, well, all the other numbers in the Land of Pi actually.</s>
 <s id="6">It was kind of a big day.</s>
 <s id="7">Anyway, the musketeers were called to action to save the Land of Pi from the voracious dragon.</s>
 <s id="8">They rode towards him on their valiant steeds and attacked.</s>
 <s id="9">First Multiplication, then Parentheses, but that didn't work.</s>
 <s id="10">The dragon continued eating people.</s>
 <s id="11">So Addition tried, but was thrown aside.</s>
 <s id="12">Exponents leaped at the beast and was quickly squashed.</s>
 <s id="13">Nothing was working.</s>
 <s id="14">The musketeers huddled and formulated a plan.</s>
 <s id="15">They would attack in sequence, but who should go first?</s>
 <s id="16">They bickered for a while, the dragon ate a few more princesses, and then they finally agreed.</s>
 <s id="17">They jumped into the first, smallest parentheses inside the great Puff the Digit Dragon.</s>
 <s id="18">Parentheses pointed out where to work first and protected Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction while they diced and sliced.</s>
 <s id="19">First here, then, move over there, then there.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">Look out!</s>
  <s id="20.2">There's another set!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">Parentheses pointed and Exponents took the lead.</s>
 <s id="22">Then, it was Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction, each in turn, always the same order.</s>
 <s id="23">P-E-M-D-A-S When they finished that set, they went to another, and another, always working inside the parentheses in PEMDAS order.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Pop!</s>
  <s id="24.2">Pop!</s>
  <s id="24.3">Pop!</s>
  <s id="24.4">Pop!</s>
  <s id="24.5">Pop!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">PEMDAS, there is another spot!</s>
 <s id="26">Don't forget, there can be parentheses inside parentheses.</s>
 <s id="27">There's one!</s>
 <s id="28">And that tricky exponent.</s>
 <s id="29">There we go!</s>
 <s id="30">Finally, the PEMDAS Musketeers had whittled Puff down to his last fearsome roar.</s>
 <s id="31">But, having vanquished Puff the Magic Digit Dragon, all the empire's numbers sprang again from this tiny little number one, and they all lived happily ever after.</s>
 <s id="32">Except for the Emperor Number, which they threw into the mouth of an ancient nesting creature in the desert.</s>
 <s id="33">The End.</s>
