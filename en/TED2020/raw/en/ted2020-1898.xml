 <s id="1">Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.</s>
 <s id="2">(Cheering) Not good enough.</s>
 <s id="3">Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?</s>
 <s id="4">(Loud cheering) My name is Maysoon Zayid, and I am not drunk, but the doctor who delivered me was.</s>
 <s id="5">He cut my mom six different times in six different directions, suffocating poor little me in the process.</s>
 <s id="6">As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which means I shake all the time.</s>
 <s id="7">Look.</s>
 <s id="8">It's exhausting.</s>
 <s id="9">I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.</s>
 <s id="10">(Laughter) CP is not genetic.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">It's not a birth defect.</s>
  <s id="11.2">You can't catch it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">No one put a curse on my mother's uterus, and I didn't get it because my parents are first cousins, which they are.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) It only happens from accidents, like what happened to me on my birth day.</s>
 <s id="14">Now, I must warn you, I'm not inspirational.</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) And I don't want anyone in this room to feel bad for me, because at some point in your life, you have dreamt of being disabled.</s>
 <s id="16">Come on a journey with me.</s>
 <s id="17">It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall, you're driving around in circles looking for parking, and what do you see?</s>
 <s id="18">Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) And you're like, "God, can't I just be a little disabled?"</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) Also, I've got to tell you, I've got 99 problems, and palsy is just one.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) If there was an Oppression Olympics, I would win the gold medal.</s>
 <s id="22">I'm Palestinian, Muslim, I'm female, I'm disabled, and I live in New Jersey.</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) (Applause) If you don't feel better about yourself, maybe you should.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.</s>
 <s id="25">I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials.</s>
 <s id="26">I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City, I could.</s>
 <s id="27">A lot of people with CP don't walk, but my parents didn't believe in "can't."</s>
 <s id="28">My father's mantra was, "You can do it, yes you can can."</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping.</s>
 <s id="30">If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A's, we all got my mother's slipper.</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking.</s>
 <s id="32">Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) My inner stripper was very strong.</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) Yeah.</s>
 <s id="35">No, by the first day of kindergarten, I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my town, and they were all my family.</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) Now there are 20 Arabs in town, and they are still all my family.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian.</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) (Applause) This was before 9/11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use "I hate Muslims" as a campaign slogan.</s>
 <s id="40">The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.</s>
 <s id="41">They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan.</s>
 <s id="42">I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) I have tap-danced on Broadway.</s>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">Yeah, on Broadway.</s>
  <s id="44.2">It's crazy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">(Applause) My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dancing school.</s>
 <s id="46">I learned how to dance in heels, which means I can walk in heels.</s>
 <s id="47">And I'm from Jersey, and we are really concerned with being chic, so if my friends wore heels, so did I.</s>
 <s id="48">And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, I did not.</s>
 <s id="49">I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Madonna.</s>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">(Laughter) Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's working!</s>
  <s id="50.2">It's working!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">(Laughter) But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.</s>
 <s id="52">I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.</s>
 <s id="53">And now I can stand on my head.</s>
 <s id="54">My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera "General Hospital."</s>
 <s id="55">(Laughter) I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU, Arizona State University, because I fit every single quota.</s>
 <s id="56">(Laughter) I was like the pet lemur of the theater department.</s>
 <s id="57">Everybody loved me.</s>
 <s id="58">I did all the less-than-intelligent kids' homework, I got A's in all of my classes, A's in all of their classes.</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) Every time I did a scene from "The Glass Menagerie," my professors would weep.</s>
 <s id="60">But I never got cast.</s>
 <s id="61">Finally, my senior year, ASU decided to do a show called "They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."</s>
 <s id="62">It's a play about a girl with CP.</s>
 <s id="63">I was a girl with CP.</s>
 <s id="64">So I start shouting from the rooftops, "I'm finally going to get a part!</s>
 <s id="65">I have cerebral palsy!</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">Free at last!</s>
  <s id="66.2">Free at last!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="67">Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"</s>
 <s id="68">I didn't get the part.</s>
 <s id="69">(Laughter) Sherry Brown got the part.</s>
 <s id="70">I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.</s>
 <s id="71">I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character."</s>
 <s id="72">(Laughter) (Applause) This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-palsy actress.</s>
 <s id="73">College was imitating life.</s>
 <s id="74">Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen.</s>
 <s id="75">Upon graduating, I moved back home, and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.</s>
 <s id="76">My dream was coming true.</s>
 <s id="77">And I knew that I would be promoted from "Diner Diner" to "Wacky Best Friend" in no time.</s>
 <s id="78">(Laughter) But instead, I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head, and it became clear to me that casting directors didn't hire fluffy, ethnic, disabled actors.</s>
 <s id="79">They only hired perfect people.</s>
 <s id="80">But there were exceptions to the rule.</s>
 <s id="81">I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg, Roseanne Barr, Ellen, and all of these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.</s>
 <s id="82">So I became a comic.</s>
 <s id="83">(Laughter) (Applause) My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with CP driving him.</s>
 <s id="84">(Laughter) I've performed in clubs all over America, and I've also performed in Arabic in the Middle East, uncensored and uncovered.</s>
 <s id="85">(Laughter) Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.</s>
 <s id="86">I never like to claim first, but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren't funny, and they find us hysterical.</s>
 <s id="87">(Laughter) In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, now in its 10th year.</s>
 <s id="88">Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous.</s>
 <s id="89">(Laughter) Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability.</s>
 <s id="90">My big break came in 2010.</s>
 <s id="91">I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show "Countdown with Keith Olbermann."</s>
 <s id="92">I walked in looking like I was going to the prom, and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.</s>
 <s id="93">(Laughter) So I looked at the stage manager and I'm like, "Excuse me, can I have another chair?"</s>
 <s id="94">And she looked at me and she went, "Five, four, three, two ..."</s>
 <s id="95">And we were live, right?</s>
 <s id="96">So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid.</s>
 <s id="97">I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back.</s>
 <s id="98">But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back, he made me a full-time contributor, and he taped down my chair.</s>
 <s id="99">(Laughter) (Applause) One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags.</s>
 <s id="100">(Laughter) People say children are cruel, but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult.</s>
 <s id="101">Suddenly, my disability on the world wide web is fair game.</s>
 <s id="102">I would look at clips online and see comments like, "Yo, why's she tweakin'?"</s>
 <s id="103">"Yo, is she retarded?"</s>
 <s id="104">And my favorite, "Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist.</s>
 <s id="105">What does she suffer from?</s>
 <s id="106">We should really pray for her."</s>
 <s id="107">One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits: screenwriter, comedian, palsy.</s>
 <s id="108">Disability is as visual as race.</s>
 <s id="109">If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé, then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.</s>
 <p id="p110">
  <s id="110.1">The disabled are the largest — Yeah, clap for that, man.</s>
  <s id="110.2">Come on.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="111">(Applause) People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment.</s>
 <s id="112">The doctors said that I wouldn't walk, but I am here in front of you.</s>
 <s id="113">However, if I grew up with social media, I don't think I would be.</s>
 <s id="114">I hope that together, we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.</s>
 <s id="115">Perhaps if there were more positive images, it would foster less hate on the Internet.</s>
 <s id="116">Or maybe not.</s>
 <s id="117">Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well.</s>
 <s id="118">My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places.</s>
 <s id="119">I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Loreen Arbus.</s>
 <s id="120">I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol, the amazing Dave Matthews.</s>
 <s id="121">I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild.</s>
 <s id="122">I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC.</s>
 <s id="123">And I founded Maysoon's Kids, a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.</s>
 <s id="124">But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- (Laughter) (Applause) But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee, has Parkinson's and shakes just like me, Muhammad Ali.</s>
 <s id="125">(Applause) (Applause ends) It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live, and I dedicate this talk to his memory.</s>
 <s id="126">(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.</s>
 <s id="127">(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid, and if I can can, you can can.</s>
 <s id="128">(Cheering) (Applause)</s>
