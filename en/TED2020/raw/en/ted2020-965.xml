 <s id="1">The Hindus say, "Nada brahma," one translation of which is, "The world is sound."</s>
 <s id="2">And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.</s>
 <s id="3">In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.</s>
 <s id="4">Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.</s>
 <s id="5">So you are, in fact, a chord -- each of you an individual chord.</s>
 <s id="6">One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Your ears can't hear that chord; they can actually hear amazing things.</s>
  <s id="7.2">Your ears can hear 10 octaves.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">Incidentally, we see just one octave.</s>
 <s id="9">Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.</s>
 <s id="10">They work even when you sleep.</s>
 <s id="11">The smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.</s>
 <s id="12">The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that.</s>
 <s id="13">Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening.</s>
 <s id="14">Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at -- it's a relationship with sound.</s>
 <s id="15">And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.</s>
 <s id="16">For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from?</s>
 <s id="17">Here are two of them.</s>
 <s id="18">Reductive listening is listening "for."</s>
 <s id="19">It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant.</s>
 <s id="20">Men typically listen reductively.</s>
 <s id="21">So he's saying, "I've got this problem."</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">He's saying, "Here's your solution.</s>
  <s id="22.2">Thanks very much.</s>
  <s id="22.3">Next."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">That's the way we talk, right guys?</s>
 <s id="24">Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for."</s>
 <s id="25">It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey.</s>
 <s id="26">Women typically listen expansively.</s>
 <s id="27">If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time.</s>
 <s id="28">(Laughter) Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk, practice expansive listening, and you can transform your relationships.</s>
 <s id="29">The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise, surrounding us all the time.</s>
 <s id="30">Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe.</s>
 <s id="31">Two percent of the population of Europe -- that's 16 million people -- are having their sleep devastated by noise like that.</s>
 <s id="32">Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe.</s>
 <s id="33">It's a really big problem.</s>
 <s id="34">Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it, you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.</s>
 <s id="35">These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.</s>
 <s id="36">It looks a bit like this.</s>
 <s id="37">The trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues.</s>
 <s id="38">The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined: "schizophonia."</s>
 <s id="39">It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear.</s>
 <s id="40">So, we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us.</s>
 <s id="41">I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia.</s>
 <s id="42">The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression.</s>
 <s id="43">We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this.</s>
 <s id="44">Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.</s>
 <s id="45">(Music) And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.</s>
 <s id="46">(Music) I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two.</s>
 <s id="47">There is a cost of compression.</s>
 <s id="48">It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.</s>
 <s id="49">You're having to imagine it.</s>
 <s id="50">It's not good for you in the long run.</s>
 <s id="51">The third problem with headphones is this: deafness -- noise-induced hearing disorder.</s>
 <s id="52">Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another, but really worryingly, 16 percent -- roughly one in six -- of American teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse.</s>
 <s id="53">One study at an American university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse.</s>
 <s id="54">We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.</s>
 <s id="55">Now that's a really serious problem.</s>
 <s id="56">I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children, please.</s>
 <s id="57">Professional hearing protectors are great; I use some all the time.</s>
 <s id="58">If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.</s>
 <s id="59">If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice, it's too loud.</s>
 <s id="60">And thirdly, if you're in bad sound, it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.</s>
 <s id="61">Protect your ears in that way.</s>
 <s id="62">Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.</s>
 <s id="63">WWB: Wind, water, birds -- stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events, all of it very healthy, all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.</s>
 <s id="64">Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.</s>
 <s id="65">Silence is beautiful.</s>
 <s id="66">The Elizabethans described language as decorated silence.</s>
 <s id="67">I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art.</s>
 <s id="68">Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.</s>
 <s id="69">It's fun to get into designing with sound.</s>
 <s id="70">If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.</s>
 <s id="71">Sound design is the future, and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.</s>
 <s id="72">I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health.</s>
 <s id="73">First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer.</s>
 <s id="74">Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.</s>
 <s id="75">Sound healing is a wonderful modality.</s>
 <s id="76">It's been around for thousands of years.</s>
 <s id="77">I do urge you to explore this.</s>
 <s id="78">There are great things being done there, treating now autism, dementia and other conditions.</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">And music, of course.</s>
  <s id="79.2">Just listening to music is good for you, if it's music that's made with good intention, made with love, generally.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.</s>
 <s id="81">There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy.</s>
 <s id="82">And four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved.</s>
 <s id="83">First of all, listen consciously.</s>
 <s id="84">I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.</s>
 <s id="85">It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.</s>
 <s id="86">Secondly, get in touch with making some sound -- create sound.</s>
 <p id="p87">
  <s id="87.1">The voice is the instrument we all play, and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice?</s>
  <s id="87.2">Get trained; learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="88">Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.</s>
 <s id="89">You can do this in groups as well.</s>
 <s id="90">It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia; to make music and sound in a group of people, whichever style you enjoy particularly.</s>
 <s id="91">And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.</s>
 <p id="p92">
  <s id="92.1">Protect your ears?</s>
  <s id="92.2">Yes, absolutely.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="93">Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work.</s>
 <s id="94">And let's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that I played you early on.</s>
 <s id="95">So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound.</s>
 <s id="96">My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things, we will take a very big step in that direction.</s>
 <s id="97">So I urge you to take that path.</s>
 <s id="98">I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.</s>
 <s id="99">I wish you sound health.</s>
 <s id="100">(Applause)</s>
