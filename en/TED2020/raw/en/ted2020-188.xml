 <s id="1">(Applause) It's really quite an honor to be here tonight, and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened because I've really been inspired.</s>
 <s id="2">And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight that are, literally, world premieres.</s>
 <s id="3">I've been working on my new record and I've never played these songs for anybody except the microphone.</s>
 <s id="4">This is a song that I wrote about the meaning of technology, which goes perfectly with this gathering.</s>
 <s id="5">I started thinking about -- when I was in college, especially as a blind person, doing a research paper was a major undertaking.</s>
 <s id="6">You had to go to the library, see if you could get them to find the books for you, you know, footnotes and all that.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Now you can just go on Google.</s>
  <s id="7.2">Just look it up.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">I wish I had that when I was in college.</s>
 <s id="9">Anyway, this is a song about: we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?</s>
 <s id="10">It's called "All the Answers."</s>
 <s id="11">♫ What is the weather in Cincinnati? ♫ ♫ What is the time in Tokyo? ♫ ♫ Who is this little child's daddy? ♫ ♫ And who the hell needs to know? ♫ ♫ Why do memories of you linger ♫ ♫ when I'm trying to reach my goal? ♫ ♫ And why must I move my fingers ♫ ♫ to the music in my soul? ♫ ♫ I don't know. ♫ ♫ I don't have to know. ♫ ♫ 'Cause here I go ... ♫ ♫ and I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers ♫ ♫ and I don't have to understand ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ Think I'll rummage through the century ♫ ♫ while I listen to the sea. ♫ ♫ Oh, it's good to be so free, ♫ ♫ so free. ♫ ♫ Who was mayor of Chicago ♫ ♫ back in 1964? ♫ ♫ And why did Shakespeare create Iago ♫ ♫ to tear apart a love so pure? ♫ ♫ How can my dreams be so vivid ♫ ♫ in a psychosonic way? ♫ ♫ Why must I become so livid ♫ ♫ about the news I hear today? ♫ ♫ I don't know. ♫ ♫ I don't have to know. ♫ ♫ And here I go ... ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here in my hand. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ See, I don't have to understand ♫ ♫ 'cause I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ I think I'll browse on through ♫ ♫ the tabloid news ♫ ♫ while I sip my tea. ♫ ♫ Mm, it's good to be so free. ♫ (Trumpet sounds) ♫ I never ever have to be alone. ♫ ♫ I can do it all right here in my home. ♫ ♫ Yeah, mm-hmm ... ♫ ♫ Everything that's ever been known, ♫ ♫ I can punch it up right here on my phone. ♫ ♫ Freedom train, coming soon ♫ ♫ right here in my living room ♫ ♫ from Baton Rouge to Saskatoon ♫ ♫ and all points in between. ♫ ♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫ ♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫ ♫ I'm going to find the capitol of Peru ♫ ♫ or the latitude of Kathmandu. ♫ ♫ I'm gonna Google it ♫ ♫ 'cause everybody's doing it. ♫ ♫ And then I'll rummage through the century. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ ♫ Yeah, yeah ♫ ♫ I got all the answers. ♫ (Applause) Thank you.</s>

  <s id="12.1">Whew!</s>
  <s id="12.2">It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">That's the first time I've ever played it.</s>
 <s id="14">(Applause) It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.</s>
 <s id="15">This next song is a song that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.</s>
 <s id="16">It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems.</s>
 <s id="17">One thing is, it's unpronounceable.</s>
 <s id="18">And it's a made-up word.</s>
 <s id="19">It's called "Tembererana."</s>
 <s id="20">And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces.</s>
 <s id="21">So "tembererana" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.</s>
 <s id="22">So this is called "Tembererana."</s>
 <s id="23">It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called "carnivalito."</s>
 <s id="24">♫ A dream within a dream, ♫ ♫ a world within a world, ♫ ♫ the sound of a primal scream ♫ ♫ travels out across the land. ♫ ♫ Images flickering, ♫ ♫ the sound of the war machine, ♫ ♫ a procession of limousines ♫ ♫ travels slowly across the land. ♫ ♫ Another child could use a hand. ♫ ♫ Reaching out from within ♫ ♫ tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Annihilation moves. ♫ ♫ The earth is an open tomb. ♫ ♫ The sound of the final boom ♫ ♫ rumbles fiercely across the land. ♫ ♫ Fear, you're the enemy. ♫ ♫ Obliterating all but thee. ♫ ♫ You see what you want to see. ♫ ♫ Before I'm blinded, I will toast ♫ ♫ the shade of power that I love most, ♫ ♫ the power of creation. ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ As a child, alone and afraid, ♫ ♫ escaping the impressions every feeling made, ♫ ♫ I would run, run away ♫ ♫ into a world where the good was the aim of the game ♫ ♫ and the sum of invisible power ♫ ♫ had a name. ♫ ♫ It's the same name. ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey, tembererana ... ♫ ♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da ♫ ♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana ♫ ♫ Tembere, tembere, tembere, tembererana, hey ♫ ♫ Tembererana, hey ♫ ♫ Tembererana ... ♫ (Applause)</s>
