 <s id="1">So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.</s>
 <s id="2">It has generated considerable insight in physics, in biology and economics, but not that much in the humanities and in history.</s>
 <s id="3">I think there's a belief that it's just impossible, that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind, that you cannot measure history.</s>
 <s id="4">But I don't think that's right.</s>
 <s id="5">I want to show you a couple of examples why.</s>
 <s id="6">So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact: that two kings separated by centuries will speak a very different language.</s>
 <s id="7">That's a powerful historical force.</s>
 <s id="8">So the king of England, Alfred the Great, will use a vocabulary and grammar that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) Now it's just the way it is.</s>
 <s id="10">Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force.</s>
 <s id="11">So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.</s>
 <s id="12">So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.</s>
 <s id="13">So you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.</s>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">"Today I walk.</s>
  <s id="14.2">Yesterday I walked."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">But some verbs are irregular.</s>
 <s id="16">"Yesterday I thought."</s>
 <s id="17">Now what's interesting about that is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.</s>
 <s id="18">Like the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular.</s>
 <s id="19">So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs through 12 centuries of English language, and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern that captures this complex historical change, namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another, it regularizes 10 times slower.</s>
 <s id="20">That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.</s>
 <s id="21">Now in some cases math can even help explain, or propose explanations for, historical forces.</s>
 <s id="22">So here Steve Pinker and I were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.</s>
 <s id="23">There's actually a well-known regularity to them where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier is 10 times smaller.</s>
 <s id="24">So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War, but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier -- like World War I.</s>
 <s id="25">So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?</s>
 <s id="26">What's the origin of this?</s>
 <s id="27">So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis, propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this, which lies in our brains.</s>
 <s id="28">This is a very well-known feature in which we perceive quantities in relative ways -- quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.</s>
 <s id="29">For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.</s>
 <s id="30">It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.</s>
 <s id="31">But it doesn't sound so much, it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.</s>
 <s id="32">So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities, as the war drags on, the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties will increase not linearly -- like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 -- but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.</s>
 <s id="33">And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.</s>
 <s id="34">So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind with a long-term historical pattern that unfolds over centuries and across continents.</s>
 <s id="35">So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them, but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.</s>
 <s id="36">The reason for that is that the historical record is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.</s>
 <s id="37">So there's about 130 million books that have been written since the dawn of time.</s>
 <s id="38">Companies like Google have digitized many of them -- above 20 million actually.</s>
 <s id="39">And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture.</s>
 <s id="40">So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.</s>
 <s id="41">And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.</s>
 <s id="42">It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.</s>
 <s id="43">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="44">(Applause)</s>
