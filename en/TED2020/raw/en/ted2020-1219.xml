 <s id="1">Hi everyone.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.</s>
 <s id="3">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="4">And I want to share with you my latest art project.</s>
 <s id="5">It's a children's book for the iPad.</s>
 <s id="6">It's a little quirky and silly.</s>
 <s id="7">It's called "Pop-It," And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.</s>
 <s id="8">(Music) So this is about potty training -- as most of you, I hope, know.</s>
 <s id="9">You can tickle the rug.</s>
 <s id="10">You can make the baby poop.</s>
 <s id="11">You can do all those fun things.</s>
 <s id="12">You can burst bubbles.</s>
 <s id="13">You can draw, as everyone should.</s>
 <s id="14">But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda.</s>
 <s id="15">At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.</s>
 <s id="16">It's not the way I was brought up.</s>
 <s id="17">So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."</s>
 <s id="18">If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.</s>
 <s id="19">You don't like it?</s>
 <s id="20">Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.</s>
 <s id="22">You know, I don't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.</s>
 <s id="23">I have to tell you about my childhood.</s>
 <s id="24">I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.</s>
 <s id="25">Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am.</s>
 <s id="26">And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.</s>
 <s id="27">Basically, I celebrated every religious function.</s>
 <s id="28">In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.</s>
 <s id="29">I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani.</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan.</s>
 <s id="31">It was a very beautiful time.</s>
 <s id="32">But I must say, I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.</s>
 <s id="33">Babri Masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century -- was demolished by Hindu activists.</s>
 <s id="34">This caused major riots in my city.</s>
 <s id="35">And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest.</s>
 <s id="36">My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims.</s>
  <s id="37.2">Be careful."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) He's like, "Huh!"</s>
 <s id="40">You know, my work is inspired by events such as this.</s>
 <s id="41">Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life.</s>
 <s id="42">Imagine history being taught differently.</s>
 <s id="43">Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?</s>
 <s id="44">I have another idea.</s>
 <s id="45">It's a children's book about Indian independence -- very patriotic.</s>
 <s id="46">But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.</s>
 <s id="47">Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.</s>
 <s id="48">(Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right.</s>
 <s id="49">Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals.</s>
 <s id="50">But they're playing geopolitics.</s>
 <s id="51">They're playing out Israel-Palestine, India-Pakistan.</s>
 <s id="52">You know, I'm making a very important argument.</s>
 <s id="53">And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage.</s>
 <s id="54">After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.</s>
 <s id="55">And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them.</s>
 <s id="56">I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy.</s>
 <s id="57">You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.</s>
 <s id="58">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="59">(Applause)</s>
