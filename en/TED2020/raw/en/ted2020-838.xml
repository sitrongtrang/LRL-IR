 <s id="1">One of the things that defines a TEDster is you've taken your passion, and you've turned it into stewardship.</s>
 <s id="2">You actually put action to the issues you care about.</s>
 <s id="3">But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out.</s>
 <s id="4">So, how do you do that?</s>
 <s id="5">One of the things I should probably tell you is, I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career, and that sort of warped my framework.</s>
 <s id="6">So, when you start to think about politicians, you've got to realize these are strange creatures.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Other than the fact that they can't tell directions, and they have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?</s>
  <s id="7.2">(Laughter) What we need to understand is: What drives the political creature?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart: One is reputation and influence.</s>
 <s id="9">These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job.</s>
 <s id="10">The second one -- unlike most animals, which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self.</s>
 <s id="11">Now you may think it's money, but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself.</s>
 <s id="12">Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.</s>
 <s id="13">So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?</s>
 <s id="14">You can send them an email.</s>
 <s id="15">Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.</s>
 <s id="16">It doesn't matter, it's spam.</s>
 <s id="17">How about you get on the phone?</s>
 <s id="18">Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone, "Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."</s>
 <s id="19">That doesn't move.</s>
 <s id="20">Face to face would work, but it's hard to set it up.</s>
 <s id="21">It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.</s>
 <s id="22">Yes, contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation, but it takes some time to build up.</s>
 <s id="23">So what actually works?</s>
 <s id="24">And the answer is rather strange.</s>
 <s id="25">It's a letter.</s>
 <s id="26">We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.</s>
 <s id="27">Letters actually work.</s>
 <s id="28">Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.</s>
 <s id="29">I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean.</s>
 <s id="30">So, how are you going to write your letter?</s>
 <s id="31">First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.</s>
 <s id="32">I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter) but this is actually critical.</s>
 <s id="33">And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter.</s>
 <s id="34">It is so novel to see this, that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me.</s>
 <s id="35">Second of all, I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.</s>
 <s id="36">Here's my promise to you: If you are consistent and do this, within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"</s>
 <s id="37">Now, I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with.</s>
 <s id="38">Now, when you approach these animals, you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.</s>
 <s id="39">So in paragraph number one, what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this: You appreciate them.</s>
 <s id="40">You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else, but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.</s>
 <s id="41">When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.</s>
 <s id="42">They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">So, here you go.</s>
  <s id="43.2">(Laughter) Paragraph number two: You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="44">When you do this, don't attack people; you attack tactics.</s>
 <s id="45">Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.</s>
 <s id="46">Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.</s>
 <s id="47">Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.</s>
 <s id="48">"Obviously, you're intelligent.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">If you had the right information, you would have done the right thing."</s>
  <s id="49.2">(Laughter) Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">You're the safe place to come in to.</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">So, in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people, "If no one is providing you with this information, let me help."</s>
  <s id="51.2">(Laughter) Animals do displays.</s>
  <s id="51.3">They do two things: They warn you or they try to attract you and say, "We need to mate."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.</s>
 <s id="53">You do a number of things: you're a vice president, you volunteer, you do something else.</s>
 <s id="54">Why is is this important?</s>
 <s id="55">Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature: that you have influence in a large sphere, and that my preservation depends on you.</s>
 <s id="56">Here is one very quick hack, especially for the feds in the audience.</s>
 <s id="57">Here's how you mail your letter.</s>
 <s id="58">First of all, you send the original to the district office.</s>
 <s id="59">So, you send the copy to the main office.</s>
 <s id="60">If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"</s>
 <s id="61">Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."</s>
 <s id="62">And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read.</s>
 <s id="63">So, what your letter means: I've got to tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.</s>
 <s id="64">(Laughter) We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.</s>
 <s id="65">I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.</s>
 <s id="66">This is an opportunity at real dialogue, and if you have stewardship and want to communicate, that dialogue is incredibly powerful.</s>
 <s id="67">So when you do that, here's what I can promise: You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.</s>
 <s id="68">Get writing.</s>
 <s id="69">(Applause)</s>
