 <s id="1">So in 2011, someone broke into my sister's office at the university where she teaches in Nigeria.</s>
 <s id="2">Now thankfully, the person was caught, arrested and charged to court.</s>
 <s id="3">When I get into court, the clerks who were assigned to my sister's case informed her that they wouldn't be able to process the paperwork unless she paid a bribe.</s>
 <s id="4">Now, at first she thought it was part of a practical joke.</s>
 <s id="5">But then she realized they were serious.</s>
 <s id="6">And then she became furious.</s>
 <s id="7">I mean, think about it: here she was, the recent victim of a crime, with the very people who were supposed to help her, and they were demanding a bribe from her.</s>
 <s id="8">That's just one of the many ways that corruption impacts millions of people in my country.</s>
 <s id="9">You know, growing up in Nigeria, corruption permeated virtually every element of the society.</s>
 <s id="10">Reports of politicians embezzling millions of dollars were common.</s>
 <s id="11">Police officers stealing money or extorting money from everyday hardworking citizens was routine practice.</s>
 <s id="12">I felt that development could never actually happen, so long as corruption persisted.</s>
 <s id="13">But over the past several years, in my research on innovation and prosperity, I've learned that corruption is actually not the problem hindering our development.</s>
 <s id="14">In fact, conventional thinking on corruption and its relationship to development is not only wrong, but it's holding many poor countries backwards.</s>
 <s id="15">So, the thinking goes like this: in a society that's poor and corrupt, our best shot at reducing corruption is to create good laws, enforce them well, and this will make way for development and innovation to flourish.</s>
 <s id="16">Now, it makes sense on paper, which is why many governments and development organizations invest billions of dollars annually on institutional reform and anti-corruption programs.</s>
 <s id="17">But many of these programs fail to reduce corruption, because we have the equation backwards.</s>
 <s id="18">You see, societies don't develop because they've reduced corruption.</s>
 <s id="19">They're able to reduce corruption because they've developed.</s>
 <s id="20">And societies develop through investments in innovation.</s>
 <s id="21">Now, at first, I thought this was impossible.</s>
 <s id="22">Why would anyone in their right mind invest in a society where, at least on the surface, it seems a terrible place to do business?</s>
 <s id="23">You know, a society where politicians are corrupt and consumers are poor?</s>
 <s id="24">But then, the more I learned about the relationship between innovation and corruption, the more I started to see things differently.</s>
 <s id="25">Here's how this played out in sub-Saharan Africa as the region developed its telecommunications industry.</s>
 <s id="26">In the late 1990s, fewer than five percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa had phones.</s>
 <s id="27">In Nigeria, for example, the country had more than 110 million people but fewer than half a million phones in the whole nation.</s>
 <s id="28">Now, this scarcity fueled widespread corruption in the industry.</s>
 <s id="29">I mean, public officials who worked for the state-owned phone companies demanded bribes from people who wanted phones.</s>
 <s id="30">And because most people couldn't afford to pay the bribes, phones were only available to those who were wealthy.</s>
 <s id="31">Then an entrepreneur named Mo Ibrahim decided that he would set up a telecommunications company on the continent.</s>
 <s id="32">Now, when he told his colleagues about his idea, they just laughed at him.</s>
 <s id="33">But Mo Ibrahim was undeterred.</s>
 <s id="34">And so in 1998, he set up Celtel.</s>
 <s id="35">The company provided affordable mobile phones and cell service to millions of Africans, in some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the region -- I mean countries such as Congo, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Uganda.</s>
 <s id="36">You see, in our research, we call what Mo Ibrahim built a "market-creating innovation."</s>
 <s id="37">Market-creating innovations transform complicated and expensive products into products that are simple and affordable, so that many more people in society could access them.</s>
 <s id="38">Now in this case, phones were expensive before Celtel made them much more affordable.</s>
 <s id="39">As other investors -- some of his colleagues, actually -- saw that it was possible to create a successful mobile phone company on the continent, they flooded in with billions of dollars of investments.</s>
 <s id="40">And this led to significant growth in the industry.</s>
 <s id="41">From barely nothing in 2000, today, virtually every African country now has a vibrant mobile telecommunications industry.</s>
 <s id="42">The sector now supports close to one billion phone connections, it has created nearly four million jobs and generates billions of dollars in taxes every year.</s>
 <s id="43">These are taxes that governments can now reinvest into the economy to build their institutions.</s>
 <s id="44">And here's the thing: because most people no longer have to bribe public officials just to get a phone, corruption -- at least within this industry -- has reduced.</s>
 <s id="45">Now, if Mo Ibrahim had waited for corruption to be fixed in all of sub-Saharan Africa before he invested, he would still be waiting today.</s>
 <s id="46">You know, most people who engage in corruption know they shouldn't.</s>
 <s id="47">I mean, the public officials who were demanding bribes from people to get phones and the people who were paying the bribes -- they knew they were breaking the law.</s>
 <s id="48">But they did it anyways.</s>
 <s id="49">The question is: Why?</s>
 <s id="50">The answer?</s>
 <s id="51">Scarcity.</s>
 <s id="52">See, whenever people would benefit from gaining access to something that scarce, this makes corruption attractive.</s>
 <s id="53">You know, in poor countries, we complain a lot about corrupt politicians who embezzle state funds.</s>
 <s id="54">But in many of those countries, economic opportunity is scarce, and so corruption becomes an attractive way to gain wealth.</s>
 <s id="55">We also complain about civil servants like police officers, who extort money from everyday hardworking citizens.</s>
 <s id="56">But most civil servants are grossly underpaid and are leading desperate lives.</s>
 <s id="57">And so for them, extortion or corruption is a good way to make a living.</s>
 <s id="58">You know, this phenomenon also plays itself out in wealthy countries as well.</s>
 <s id="59">When rich parents bribe university officials -- (Laughter) When rich parents bribe university officials so their children can gain admission into elite colleges, the circumstance is different, but the principle is the same.</s>
 <s id="60">I mean, admission into elite colleges is scarce, and so bribery becomes attractive.</s>
 <s id="61">The thing is, I'm not trying to say there shouldn't be things that are scarce in society or things that are selective.</s>
 <s id="62">What I'm just trying to explain is this relationship between corruption and scarcity.</s>
 <s id="63">And in most poor countries, way too many basic things are scarce.</s>
 <s id="64">I mean things like food, education, health care, economic opportunity, jobs.</s>
 <s id="65">This creates the perfect breeding ground for corruption to thrive.</s>
 <s id="66">Now, in no way does this excuse corrupt behavior.</s>
 <s id="67">It just helps us understand it a bit better.</s>
 <s id="68">Investing in businesses that make things affordable and accessible to so many more people attacks this scarcity and creates the revenues for governments to reinvest in their economies.</s>
 <s id="69">Now, when this happens on a countrywide level, it can revolutionize nations.</s>
 <s id="70">Consider the impact in South Korea.</s>
 <s id="71">Now, in the 1950s, South Korea was a desperately poor country, and it was very corrupt.</s>
 <s id="72">The country was ruled by an authoritarian government and engaged in bribery and embezzlement.</s>
 <s id="73">In fact, economists at the time said South Korea was trapped in poverty, and they referred to it as "an economic basket case."</s>
 <s id="74">When you looked at South Korea's institutions, even as late as the 1980s, they were on par with some of the poorest and most corrupt African countries at the time.</s>
 <s id="75">But as companies like Samsung, Kia, Hyundai invested in innovations that made things much more affordable for so many more people, South Korea ultimately became prosperous.</s>
 <s id="76">As the country grew prosperous, it was able to transition from an authoritarian government to a democratic government and has been able to reinvest in building its institutions.</s>
 <s id="77">And this has paid off tremendously.</s>
 <s id="78">For instance, in 2018, South Korea's president was sentenced to 25 years in prison on corruption-related charges.</s>
 <s id="79">This could never have happened decades ago when the country was poor and ruled by an authoritarian government.</s>
 <s id="80">In fact, as we looked at most prosperous countries today, what we found was, they were able to reduce corruption as they became prosperous -- not before.</s>
 <s id="81">And so where does that leave us?</s>
 <s id="82">I know it may sound like I'm saying we should just ignore corruption.</s>
 <s id="83">That's not what I'm saying at all.</s>
 <s id="84">What I'm suggesting, though, is that corruption, especially for most people in poor countries, is a work-around.</s>
 <s id="85">It's a utility in a place where there are fewer better options to solve a problem.</s>
 <s id="86">Investing in innovations that make products much more affordable for many people not only attacks this scarcity but it creates a sustainable source of revenue for governments to reinvest into the economies to strengthen their institutions.</s>
 <s id="87">This is the critical missing piece in the economic development puzzle that will ultimately help us reduce corruption.</s>
 <s id="88">You know, I lost hope in Nigeria when I was 16.</s>
 <s id="89">And in some ways, the country has actually gotten worse.</s>
 <s id="90">In addition to widespread poverty and endemic corruption, Nigeria now actually deals with terrorist organizations like Boko Haram.</s>
 <s id="91">But somehow, I am more hopeful about Nigeria today than I have ever been before.</s>
 <s id="92">When I see organizations investing in innovations that are creating jobs for people and making things affordable -- I mean organizations like Lifestores Pharmacy, making drugs and pharmaceuticals more affordable for people; or Metro Africa Xpress, tackling the scarcity of distribution and logistics for many small businesses; or Andela, creating economic opportunity for software developers -- I am optimistic about the future.</s>
 <s id="93">I hope you will be, too.</s>
 <s id="94">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="95">(Applause)</s>
