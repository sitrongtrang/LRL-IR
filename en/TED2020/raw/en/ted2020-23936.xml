 <s id="1">When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned their lines from a script, which essentially tells them what to say and when to say it.</s>
 <s id="2">A piece of written music operates on exactly the same principle.</s>
 <s id="3">In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play and when to play it.</s>
 <s id="4">Aesthetically speaking, there's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks to create their music: notes.</s>
 <s id="5">And although the end result can sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes is actually pretty straightforward.</s>
 <s id="6">Let's take a look at the foundational elements to music notation and how they interact to create a work of art.</s>
 <s id="7">Music is written on five parallel lines that go across the page.</s>
 <s id="8">These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right.</s>
 <s id="9">The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note or what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it.</s>
 <s id="10">Let's start with pitch.</s>
 <s id="11">To help us out, we're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much any instrument you can think of.</s>
 <s id="12">In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.</s>
 <s id="13">After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on.</s>
 <s id="14">But how do these pitches get their names?</s>
 <s id="15">Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound pretty similar compared to, say, a B.</s>
 <s id="16">Going back to the staff, every line and every space between two lines represents a separate pitch.</s>
 <s id="17">If we put a note on one of these lines or one of these spaces, we're telling a performer to play that pitch.</s>
 <s id="18">The higher up on the staff a note is placed, the higher the pitch.</s>
 <s id="19">But there are obviously many, many more pitches than the nine that these lines and spaces gives us.</s>
 <s id="20">A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes.</s>
 <s id="21">So how do we condense 88 notes onto a single staff?</s>
 <s id="22">We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure placed at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular line or space corresponds to a specific note on your instrument.</s>
 <s id="23">If we want to play notes that aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw extra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them.</s>
 <s id="24">If we have to draw so many ledger lines that it gets confusing, then we need to change to a different clef.</s>
 <s id="25">As for telling a performer when to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm.</s>
 <s id="26">The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring.</s>
 <s id="27">It sounds like this.</s>
 <s id="28">(Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily.</s>
 <s id="29">It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really.</s>
 <s id="30">The point is that just like the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long as every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time that are all the same length: beats.</s>
 <s id="31">With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music really starts to happen.</s>
 <s id="32">This is a quarter note.</s>
 <s id="33">It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat.</s>
 <s id="34">This is a half note, and it's worth two beats.</s>
 <s id="35">This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each.</s>
 <s id="36">"Great," you say, "what does that mean?"</s>
 <s id="37">You might have noticed that across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it into small sections.</s>
 <s id="38">These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar.</s>
 <s id="39">At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer how many beats are in each bar.</s>
 <s id="40">This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on.</s>
 <s id="41">The bottom number tells us what kind of note is to be used as the basic unit for the beat.</s>
 <s id="42">One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on.</s>
 <s id="43">So this time signature here tells us that there are four quarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on.</s>
 <s id="44">But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes with different rhythms.</s>
 <s id="45">Notice that even though the number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats in each bar hasn't.</s>
 <s id="46">So, what does our musical creation sound like?</s>
 <s id="47">(Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe a bit thin, right?</s>
 <s id="48">Let's add another instrument with its own pitch and rhythm.</s>
 <s id="49">Now it's sounding like music.</s>
 <s id="50">Sure, it takes some practice to get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber.</s>
