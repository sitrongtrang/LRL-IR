 <s id="1">I love fashion.</s>
 <s id="2">I actually go to bed every night thinking about what I'm going to wear the next day.</s>
 <s id="3">Clothing transforms me, defines me, gives me confidence.</s>
 <s id="4">You may not feel the same way about fashion, but I bet you have a favorite T-shirt or a pair of jeans that transforms you -- makes you feel good, makes you feel confident, makes you feel like you.</s>
 <s id="5">When I was younger, I wanted to be Betsey Johnson.</s>
 <s id="6">I thought we were kindred, crazy-hair spirits together.</s>
 <s id="7">I did go to fashion design, I worked in the industry for years and loved it.</s>
 <s id="8">I married, I had three kids.</s>
 <s id="9">But life can be heartbreakingly ironic.</s>
 <s id="10">My middle child, Oliver, was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, or MD.</s>
 <s id="11">MD affects his muscle strength, his pulmonary system, distorts his body and makes everyday life more challenging than most.</s>
 <s id="12">From the time he could walk, which wasn't until about two and a half, he had to wear leg braces for stability.</s>
 <s id="13">Because he wasn't growing appropriately, he had to wear a feeding tube that was placed on his face.</s>
 <s id="14">He endured stares, and so did I.</s>
 <s id="15">But my husband Greg and I told him that no matter what, he was just like everybody else.</s>
 <s id="16">But everyday tasks for Oliver that we all take for granted were incredibly challenging.</s>
 <s id="17">That simple act of dressing yourself -- the very thing that I adore -- was a nightmare for him.</s>
 <s id="18">His form of MD does not affect his mind.</s>
 <s id="19">His brain is an A-plus, which means he's acutely aware of his shortcomings.</s>
 <s id="20">This became very evident when he started school, and that daily act of dressing yourself was a constant reminder of what he could and could not do.</s>
 <s id="21">So our solution was for Oliver to wear sweatpants every day: to school, to parties, on vacations -- his uniform.</s>
 <s id="22">For special occasions, he would wear proper pants.</s>
 <s id="23">But many times, because he couldn't manage the button and zipper, I would have to take him to the men's room, which was incredibly embarrassing for him and the other men that were in there.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">But them -- I said, "Oh, please.</s>
  <s id="24.2">There's nothing I haven't seen before."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">(Laughter) For years we muddled through.</s>
 <s id="26">But when Oliver was in third grade, I found out he was more like me than I ever imagined.</s>
 <s id="27">Oliver, too, cared about fashion.</s>
 <s id="28">He came home from school one day and said very definitively that he was going to wear jeans to school like everybody else gets to wear.</s>
 <s id="29">Well, I certainly couldn't go to class with him and take him to the boys' room, but there was no way I was telling my eight-year-old that he couldn't wear what he wanted to wear.</s>
 <s id="30">So that night, I MacGyvered the hell out of his jeans.</s>
 <s id="31">I remembered when I was pregnant and unwilling to stop wearing my own favorite pants, even though I was busting out of them, that rubber-band trick.</s>
 <s id="32">You moms remember what I'm talking about?</s>
 <s id="33">The rubber band through the buttonhole, around the button and back?</s>
 <s id="34">Instant stretch.</s>
 <s id="35">So I removed the zipper so he could pull it up and down on his own.</s>
 <s id="36">I cut up the side seam of the bottom of his pants to accommodate for his leg braces, applied Velcro -- hold your ears, everybody: peel and stick, mind you -- so that it would close around it.</s>
 <s id="37">When I showed Oliver my arts and crafts project, he absolutely beamed.</s>
 <s id="38">He went into school with his head held so high.</s>
 <s id="39">Those jeans transformed him.</s>
 <s id="40">He was able to get dressed on his own, he was able to go to the bathroom on his own; those jeans gave him confidence.</s>
 <s id="41">I didn't realize it at the time, but this was my first foray into the world of adaptive clothing.</s>
 <s id="42">Adaptive clothing is defined as clothing designed for people with disabilities, the elderly and anyone who struggles with dressing themselves.</s>
 <s id="43">Adaptive clothing did exist, but it was missing that mainstream fashion component.</s>
 <s id="44">It was very medicinal and very functional but not stylish.</s>
 <s id="45">And that's a huge problem, because what you wear matters.</s>
 <s id="46">Clothing can affect your mood, your health and your self-esteem.</s>
 <s id="47">Now, being a fashion lover, I've known this forever, but scientists actually have a name for it.</s>
 <s id="48">It's called "Enclothed Cognition," the co-occurrence of two factors: the symbolic meaning of clothing and the physical experience of wearing the clothing, both of which have a direct correlation to how you feel about yourself.</s>
 <s id="49">There's actually a professor in the UK by the name of Karen J. Pine.</s>
 <s id="50">She wrote a book called "Mind What You Wear: The Psychology of Fashion."</s>
 <s id="51">She states in her book that when you put clothes on, you adapt the characteristics of what you're wearing, whether you realize it or not.</s>
 <s id="52">That's why you feel like a rock star when you put on those perfect-fitting jeans.</s>
 <s id="53">That's why you feel invincible when you put on that power suit, and that's why you feel beautiful in that little black dress.</s>
 <s id="54">But that's exactly why Oliver felt so isolated when he couldn't wear what he wanted to wear.</s>
 <s id="55">He even said to me one time, "Mom, wearing sweatpants every day makes me feel like I'm dressing disabled."</s>
 <s id="56">There are one billion people on our planet that experience some type of disability.</s>
 <s id="57">One billion.</s>
 <s id="58">If 10 percent of that billion experience clothing challenges, that's an enormous amount of people that may not be as confident, as successful or even as happy as they could be.</s>
 <s id="59">The morning after Oliver left for school wearing those jeans, I realized that I could do something about that.</s>
 <s id="60">And so I did.</s>
 <s id="61">In 2013, I founded an organization called Runway of Dreams.</s>
 <s id="62">The mission was to educate the fashion industry that modifications could be made to mainstream clothing for this community that has never been served.</s>
 <s id="63">And it began with an entire year of research.</s>
 <s id="64">I went to schools, I went to facilities, I went to hospitals.</s>
 <s id="65">I literally chased down people on the street who were in wheelchairs or if they had walkers or even if they had a slight limp.</s>
 <s id="66">(Laughter) I know I must have looked insane, but I knew that if I was really going to make a difference, I had to truly understand the clothing challenges of as many different people as I possibly could.</s>
 <s id="67">I met a young man who was 18 who has cerebral palsy.</s>
 <s id="68">He was going to Harvard University.</s>
 <s id="69">He said to me, "Can you imagine?</s>
 <s id="70">I got myself into Harvard, but my dream is to be able to wear jeans on campus, like the other freshmen will wear."</s>
 <s id="71">I met a little girl named Gianna, who was missing her left forearm and her hand.</s>
 <s id="72">Her mother told me she could not bear to see her daughter's difference magnified by a dangling sleeve, so she had every single long-sleeve shirt professionally tailored.</s>
 <s id="73">Can you imagine the time and money she spent?</s>
 <s id="74">I also had the great privilege of spending time with Eric LeGrand, former Rutgers football player who was paralyzed during a tackle in 2010.</s>
 <s id="75">I had, at this point, seen some unfathomable things, but this, by far, was the most heart-stopping.</s>
 <s id="76">You see, Eric is a really big guy, and it took two aides and a lifting machine to get him dressed.</s>
 <s id="77">I sat and watched this process for over two hours.</s>
 <s id="78">When I expressed my shock to Eric, he looked at me and said, "Mindy, this is every single day.</s>
 <s id="79">What can I say?</s>
 <s id="80">I like to look sharp."</s>
 <s id="81">Research done.</s>
 <s id="82">I knew that if I was going to make a change in the industry, I had to use my background and really figure out how to make these clothes modified.</s>
 <s id="83">So I took the information I gathered over that past year, and I figured out that there were actually three categories that were affected across the board.</s>
 <s id="84">The first were closures.</s>
 <s id="85">Buttons, snaps, zippers, hook-and-eyes were a challenge for almost everybody.</s>
 <s id="86">So I replaced them with a more manageable technology: magnets.</s>
 <s id="87">Magnets made our Harvard freshman able to wear jeans on campus, because he could dress himself.</s>
 <s id="88">Second: adjustability.</s>
 <s id="89">Pant lengths, sleeve lengths, waistbands were a challenge for so many different-shaped bodies.</s>
 <s id="90">So I added elastic, an internal hemming system.</s>
 <s id="91">This way, Gianna could wear a shirt right off the rack and just adjust the one sleeve.</s>
 <s id="92">Last: alternate ways to get the clothing on and off the body, outside the traditional way of over your head.</s>
 <s id="93">So I designed a way to go in arms first.</s>
 <s id="94">This, for somebody like Eric, could actually take five steps off his dressing process and give him back the gift of time.</s>
 <s id="95">So I went out, I bought clothing right off the rack, I sat at my kitchen table, ripped them apart, did prototype after prototype, until I felt I had great modifications.</s>
 <s id="96">And then I was ready for the big leagues: the fashion industry.</s>
 <s id="97">Rather than designing my own collection, I knew if I was really going to make a difference, I had to go mainstream.</s>
 <s id="98">I believed that I just needed to educate the industry of the enormity of this population and the fact that these were consumers that simply weren't being considered.</s>
 <s id="99">And I am thrilled to say that the industry heard me.</s>
 <s id="100">Runway of Dreams collaborated with the most amazing, forward-thinking brand on our planet -- (Applause) who took my vision to market and made fashion history by launching the first mainstream adaptive collection.</s>
 <s id="101">And the rest is yet to come.</s>
 <s id="102">(Applause) So -- (Applause) Fashion holds the key to a vital lifeline.</s>
 <s id="103">Clothing can be transformative.</s>
 <s id="104">Clothing equals confidence.</s>
 <s id="105">So tomorrow, when you are starting your day and you're thinking about what you're going to wear, I hope you appreciate the process and think about how what you chose makes you feel.</s>
 <s id="106">Today, Oliver is 13.</s>
 <s id="107">He wears his adaptive khakis, his magnetic button-front shirt -- feels like the coolest kid around.</s>
 <s id="108">My boy has total swagger.</s>
 <s id="109">(Laughter) As I mentioned, Oliver's disease is degenerative, which means his muscles are going to break down over time.</s>
 <s id="110">This, by far, is the most devastating part for me.</s>
 <s id="111">I have to sit on the sidelines and watch my boy deteriorate.</s>
 <s id="112">And there's nothing I can do about it.</s>
 <s id="113">So I am looking up from the things that I cannot control to the things that I can, because I have no option.</s>
 <s id="114">And so, I am looking up.</s>
 <s id="115">And I'm asking the fashion industry to look up.</s>
 <s id="116">And now, I'm asking all of you to look up, too.</s>
 <s id="117">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="118">(Applause)</s>
