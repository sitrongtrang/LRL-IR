 <s id="1">(Directing Bailey in English) Hello, everyone.</s>
 <s id="2">My name is Yuko Morita.</s>
 <s id="3">This is a facility dog, Bailey.</s>
 <s id="4">When you were a kid, were you afraid of getting shots?</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">When you were getting a flu shot at school, you probably asked your friends, 'Did it hurt?</s>
  <s id="5.2">Did it hurt?'</s>
  <s id="5.3">As you know, kids are very afraid of injections or having their blood drawn.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">Hospitalised children have to have their blood drawn so many times.</s>
 <s id="7">Some kids need bone-marrow aspirations by drilling a thick needle into their spine.</s>
 <s id="8">This dog, Bailey has the magical power to make these kids say: 'If Bailey is with me, I would put up with it 100 more times'.</s>
 <s id="9">He is such a competent dog.</s>
 <s id="10">The Japanese medical level is said to be top-notch, for curing diseases.</s>
 <s id="11">But in Japan, while 'to be patient' has been considered a virtue, it is said that the quality of hospitalised life is poorly supported.</s>
 <s id="12">I used to work as a registered nurse at a children's hospital in Tokyo.</s>
 <s id="13">One day a mother of a hospitalised kid said, 'This is almost like being in jail'.</s>
 <s id="14">I was thinking that I was working very hard for the children, and I was very shocked to hear that.</s>
 <s id="15">In fact, kids in the hospital are not supposed to go out even for a walk.</s>
 <s id="16">They are not allowed to have their favourite foods.</s>
 <s id="17">They barely have fun.</s>
 <s id="18">Some kids stop smiling.</s>
 <s id="19">When I think back about it, it might as well be called a jail.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">At that time, I was with an NPO called 'Shine On!</s>
  <s id="20.2">Kids' and they offered to let me become a handler of a service dog.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">The Non-Profit Organisation was founded to emotionally support kids and their families who are suffering from childhood cancer and other incurable diseases.</s>
 <s id="22">At that time, I only knew that a dog is taken to a children's hospital and the dog works as a member of the medical staff -- there were a number of facility dogs working in Europe and the US, yet obiously none in Japan; that was all I knew about facility dogs.</s>
 <s id="23">I thought 'If a service dog were working in this ward, the children's hospital life, once called a jail, would be way happier', and I was excited to think so.</s>
 <s id="24">Without hesitation I said, 'Yes, I would love to'.</s>
 <s id="25">There is no training institutions for facility dog program in Japan.</s>
 <s id="26">Both Bailey and I were trained at a Hawaiian training centre.</s>
 <s id="27">In a children's hospital in Hawaii, we also practiced following around our senior facility dog and their handler.</s>
 <s id="28">To my surprise, the service dog went into the ICU.</s>
 <s id="29">The intensive-care unit is where seriously ill patients are taken care of.</s>
 <s id="30">There was a child who had just gotten out of surgery with their head half-shaven, and a large scar on their head.</s>
 <s id="31">The kid was frowing painfully.</s>
 <s id="32">To my great concern, 'Is it really OK to go there in such a serious situation?' the facility dog went in there, and climbed on the bed right beside the kid laying with the tubes around them, and went to sleep alongside the kid.</s>
 <s id="33">Then the kid grew relaxed.</s>
 <s id="34">In spite of all the pain of moving, the kid hugged the dog and closed their eyes.</s>
 <s id="35">The kid looked so calm and easy.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">At the sight of it, I thought ’WOW, that's cool!’</s>
  <s id="36.2">Being excited about making all the hospital wards full of smiles, I came back to Japan with Bailey.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">However, facility dogs are totally unprecedented in Japan.</s>
 <s id="38">The Western mindset for dogs is totally different from that of Japan.</s>
 <s id="39">In Europe and the US, it's been quite normal to have dogs in the house as family members.</s>
 <s id="40">On the other hand, in Japan, we have a history of having them outside.</s>
 <s id="41">It is outrageous to have a dog inside the hospital ward: that was what Japanese hospitals thought.</s>
 <s id="42">Before us, sometimes there were dogs volunteered to visit hospitals in Japan.</s>
 <s id="43">But there was not a precedent of having a dog in hospital everyday, and considering dogs as a medical staff.</s>
 <s id="44">What was right in Hawaii was far from right in Japan.</s>
 <s id="45">We desperately looked for a hospital that could accept Bailey as a staff.</s>
 <s id="46">Then eventually we were accepted by the Shizuoka Children's Hospital.</s>
 <s id="47">But the reality was that people said; 'Can't the dog be replaced with a dog robot?' or 'To protect kids against infections, do not enter this ward'.</s>
 <s id="48">At first we could enter only one ward.</s>
 <s id="49">So one-day of rounds was finished in a few minutes.</s>
 <s id="50">We got to the workplace and an hour later, it was time to go home.</s>
 <s id="51">'I don't think Japanese culture is going to make people want to adopt a facility dog programme', I could only think in a negative way.</s>
 <s id="52">But in fact, children needed Bailey.</s>
 <s id="53">Five years have passed, and now we are accepted by almost all wards.</s>
 <s id="54">Bailey brings about positive differences to both kids and their families', -- that was what doctors and nurses started to notice.</s>
 <s id="55">There was a child who was visually impaired and was always screaming in panic when they had their blood collected.</s>
 <s id="56">But with Bailey by their side, they were distracted by petting Bailey on the head, the kid could go through blood tests without crying.</s>
 <s id="57">Another kid who wouldn’t move at all due to pain after surgery suddenly got up just because they wanted to see Bailey.</s>
 <s id="58">That was a big surprise to the doctor.</s>
 <s id="59">A family, who are suddenly told that their child has cancer, will pretend as if nothing happening to prevent their kid from being nervous.</s>
 <s id="60">But people cannot suppress their feelings for good.</s>
 <s id="61">Sometimes it is important to cry.</s>
 <s id="62">With somebody who is human, they would feel a need 'to say something'.</s>
 <s id="63">But to Bailey, they never have to say anything if they do not want to.</s>
 <s id="64">I saw a mother in a hospital corridor, after hugging Bailey, crying as she wanted and with a relaxed expression, she went back to her kid's bed.</s>
 <s id="65">Bailey was a positive influence for their families, too.</s>
 <s id="66">Then I found there are three important bonds for a facility dog.</s>
 <s id="67">One is a bond between Bailey and the kids, another is Bailey and his handler, and the other is Bailey and the medical staff.</s>
 <s id="68">These are three important bonds with Bailey.</s>
 <s id="69">The first bond is: as Bailey works at the same hospital everyday, he sees the same children many times.</s>
 <s id="70">For children, just having a dog is not good enough.</s>
 <s id="71">Bailey, who comes to them everyday, really matters.</s>
 <s id="72">Only with Bailey who has bonds with the kids, can they be courageous enough to hang in there.</s>
 <s id="73">Even with a dog phobia, almost all kids will come to like Bailey eventually.</s>
 <s id="74">For kids, Bailey is a teammate with a tail who fight against their illness.</s>
 <s id="75">Bailey can even enter the surgical theatre with a child.</s>
 <s id="76">Even an adult is scared of getting an operation, right?</s>
 <s id="77">Wondering 'Does it hurt?', or feeling scared, they have to spend the terrifying time from the ward to the theatre.</s>
 <s id="78">But holding Bailey's leash, walking with him, children can guide Bailey smiling and walking to the theatre.</s>
 <s id="79">It is a privilege walk with everyone's favourite Bailey, without anyone else!</s>
 <s id="80">Some kids walk playfully around Bailey's fluffy tail as if they are cats.</s>
 <s id="81">Some kids say smiling, 'Bailey's wagging his tail means Good Luck'.</s>
 <s id="82">In this way, scary feelings turn to exciting feelings; which encourages kids to go to the theatre.</s>
 <s id="83">The second bond is: between a facility dog and their hander, who live together twenty-four seven.</s>
 <s id="84">We always spend holidays together too.</s>
 <s id="85">This is very important; just getting together while working and saying 'Bye-Bye' after five doesn't make any sense.</s>
 <s id="86">We sleep at night and Bailey sleeps with his head on my arm.</s>
 <s id="87">The bond between a facility dog and their handler is the basis on which a facility dog works professionally.</s>
 <s id="88">Only the bond with me can convince Bailey to trust me to work together.</s>
 <s id="89">But the truth is; you may think that a training dog will do anything I say, Bailey is a stubborn guy who goes only where he wants.</s>
 <s id="90">To a direction he doesn't to want to go, he does like this.</s>
 <s id="91">Can you see he is hanging on with all his might?</s>
 <s id="92">Planting his feet firmly on the ground, digging his nails into it, he never goes where he doesn't want to.</s>
 <s id="93">While walking on the street, I sometimes struggle with Bailey sitting there.</s>
 <s id="94">People passing by always say laughing, 'That's troublesome'.</s>
 <s id="95">But he has never refused to go to the hospital.</s>
 <s id="96">On the contrary, he sometimes refuses to go home, squatting there, going back into the hospital ward.</s>
 <s id="97">Dogs easily understand what people are thinking about them.</s>
 <s id="98">Because there are many people who love him, Bailey loves the hospital very much.</s>
 <s id="99">Both a dog and people are mutually affected; that is where the facility dog belongs.</s>
 <s id="100">This is why non-sentient toy dogs cannot make this happen.</s>
 <s id="101">A robot dog can not make this happen.</s>
 <s id="102">The third bond is between Bailey and the medical staff.</s>
 <s id="103">The handler of a facility dog is a medical staff.</s>
 <s id="104">The reason why only medical staff can be a handler of a facility dog is: that a facility dog's work includes not only healing mentally, but also curing physically.</s>
 <s id="105">Bailey and I sometimes take a part in the conversations where treatment courses of patients are decided.</s>
 <s id="106">I also figure out how our patient kids are and work out how to approach this patient.</s>
 <s id="107">I also write on the medical charts.</s>
 <s id="108">In this way, to be involved with specific purpose is what only facility dogs are capable of, and why a handler of a facility dog must be certified medical staff.</s>
 <s id="109">It has been five years since Bailey and I started working in Japan.</s>
 <s id="110">We have met thousands of children.</s>
 <s id="111">We once met a kid in the terminal phase of disease and the kid could not eat.</s>
 <s id="112">He wanted to but he couldn't eat; that was his situation.</s>
 <s id="113">Given a short span of time, both his family and nurses wished that he could enjoy whatever little amount of food he could.</s>
 <s id="114">Then there was a suggestion made Bailey attended at his dinner table.</s>
 <s id="115">With Bailey, the kid was happy to sit up smiling.</s>
 <s id="116">Saying, 'Bailey, look at me', though it was only a few mouthful, but he could managed to grab spaghetti into his mouth.</s>
 <s id="117">He could also enjoy ice cream, not being forced to do so, but willingly to do so.</s>
 <s id="118">Only the presence of Bailey bedside could make that level of change.</s>
 <s id="119">The bad impression of a hospital changed so much as to make children say, 'I want to be hospitalised to see Bailey'.</s>
 <s id="120">With Bailey, kids can double their fun.</s>
 <s id="121">With Bailey, kids can share tears and fears.</s>
 <s id="122">Most children are discharged from hospital safe and sound.</s>
 <s id="123">But sadly, some kids have to leave this world forever, and Bailey sometimes sleeps with them till just before their last moments.</s>
 <s id="124">We say 'You know, Bailey's with you', 'It's warm, isn't?' to kids.</s>
 <s id="125">The time goes on sadly but warmly.</s>
 <s id="126">We sometimes attend a funeral for children.</s>
 <s id="127">When parents have to close the lid of their own child's coffin, can you imagine how they feel?</s>
 <s id="128">In fact every family says 'We were really happy to have Bailey with us'.</s>
 <s id="129">They always say that.</s>
 <s id="130">'Before Bailey, the hospital stay had been just so heart-wrenching'.</s>
 <s id="131">'With Bailey our kid's life changed so much'.</s>
 <s id="132">These are what bereaved families said to us.</s>
 <s id="133">A family who lost their child will reflect on their child everyday, through their long span of life.</s>
 <s id="134">Remembering their child as 'a poor soul who went through so many painful operations; or remembering their child as 'a laughing kid sleeping with Bailey just before death; their feelings are completely different, aren't they?</s>
 <s id="135">We wish to make a small portion of happiness in their heartbreaking memory.</s>
 <s id="136">We wish the bereaved family remember as many smiles of their kid as possible.</s>
 <s id="137">The Facility Dog Programme is not an option, but necessity for hospital care, that's what I strongly feel about it.</s>
 <s id="138">Japan's medical care is said to be the highest in the world.</s>
 <s id="139">Not just curing disease, but also having an environment for healing disease more proactively is necessary, I think.</s>
 <s id="140">For patients, they can't have too much fun.</s>
 <s id="141">There are a lot of facility dogs in Europe and the US, but in Japan we have only two.</s>
 <s id="142">I would like to have facility dogs as a standard in Japanese hospitals and make Japanese hospitals a fun place to be in, even for patients who have medical conditions.</s>
 <s id="143">So many children who passed away are watching for us from heaven.</s>
 <p id="p144">
  <s id="144.1">For those kids, I would like to make the Japanese medical front a place where I can be proud to say, 'Hey, it's a good hospital, isn't it?'</s>
  <s id="144.2">(Applause)</s>
