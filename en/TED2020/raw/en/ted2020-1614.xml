 <s id="1">So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.</s>
 <s id="2">It makes me to stand here, the fame, the money I got out of it.</s>
 <s id="3">So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.</s>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">What you did in the early marriage days, you tried to impress your wife.</s>
  <s id="4.2">I did the same.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">On that occasion, I found my wife carrying something like this.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">I saw.</s>
  <s id="6.2">"What is that?"</s>
  <s id="6.3">I asked.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">My wife replied, "None of your business."</s>
 <s id="8">Then, being her husband, I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.</s>
 <s id="9">I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.</s>
 <s id="10">Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days.</s>
 <s id="11">Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?</s>
 <s id="12">She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads], but myself and my sisters, if they start using that, we have to cut our family milk budget.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Then I was shocked.</s>
  <s id="13.2">What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">And it's called affordability.</s>
 <s id="15">I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.</s>
 <s id="16">I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.</s>
 <s id="17">That fellow looks left and right, and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper, gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">I don't know why.</s>
  <s id="18.2">I did not ask for a condom.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p19">
  <s id="19.1">Then I took that pad.</s>
  <s id="19.2">I want to see that.</s>
  <s id="19.3">What is inside it?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="20">The very first time, at the age of 29, that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.</s>
 <s id="21">I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?</s>
 <s id="22">They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.</s>
 <s id="23">Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.</s>
 <s id="24">Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?</s>
 <s id="25">That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?</s>
 <s id="26">It's not like I can just check it in the lab.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">I need a woman volunteer.</s>
  <s id="27.2">Where can I get one in India?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.</s>
 <s id="29">So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.</s>
 <s id="30">Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">"Close your eyes.</s>
  <s id="31.2">Whatever I give, it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring, even a chocolate, I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Close your eyes."</s>
 <s id="33">Because I tried to make it intimate.</s>
 <s id="34">Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.</s>
 <s id="36">Then other victims, they got into my sisters.</s>
 <s id="37">But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.</s>
 <s id="38">That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.</s>
 <s id="39">They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.</s>
 <s id="40">Why I am not getting [any]?</s>
 <s id="41">You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.</s>
 <s id="42">Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">They also refused.</s>
  <s id="43.2">Finally, I decide, use sanitary pad myself.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="44">Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">Armstrong.</s>
  <s id="45.2">Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest, like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">I wore a sanitary pad.</s>
  <s id="46.2">I filled animal blood in a football bottle, I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties, while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press, doses of blood will go there.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect.</s>
  <s id="47.2">That five days I'll never forget -- the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="48">My God, it's unbelievable.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">But here the problem is, one company is making napkin out of cotton.</s>
  <s id="49.2">It is working well.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton.</s>
  <s id="50.2">It's not working.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="51">That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.</s>
 <s id="52">You need first funds.</s>
 <s id="53">Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research, I come through all sorts of problems, including a divorce notice from my wife.</s>
 <p id="p54">
  <s id="54.1">Why is this?</s>
  <s id="54.2">I used medical college girls.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="55">She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood, but even after that, you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material.</s>
  <s id="56.2">Again, a stop-up.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.</s>
 <s id="58">In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant, anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.</s>
 <s id="59">That is my invention.</s>
 <s id="60">So after that, what I did, usually if anyone got a patent or an invention, immediately you want to make, convert into this.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">I never did this.</s>
  <s id="61.2">I dropped it just like this, because you do this, if anyone runs after money, their life will not [have] any beauty.</s>
  <s id="61.3">It is boredom.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">A lot of people making a lot of money, billion, billions of dollars accumulating.</s>
 <s id="63">Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?</s>
 <s id="64">Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?</s>
 <s id="65">What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">That's why I am giving this machine only in rural India, for rural women, because in India, [you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women are using sanitary pads.</s>
  <s id="66.2">The rest, they're using a rag cloth, a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">It is the same in the 21st century.</s>
  <s id="67.2">That's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries.</s>
 <s id="69">Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.</s>
 <s id="70">A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?</s>
 <s id="71">That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.</s>
 <s id="72">(Applause) Play video one.</s>
 <s id="73">(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, "Why are you using that nasty cloth?"</s>
 <s id="74">She replied immediately, "I know about napkins, but if I start using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."</s>
 <s id="75">Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?</s>
 <s id="76">So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups.</s>
 <s id="77">That is my idea.</s>
 <p id="p78">
  <s id="78.1">AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment for machine and all.</s>
  <s id="78.2">Now, any rural woman can.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="79">They are performing puja.</s>
 <s id="80">(Video): (Singing) You just think, competing giants, even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.</s>
 <s id="81">I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.</s>
 <s id="82">I'm sustaining on seventh year.</s>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">Already 600 installations.</s>
  <s id="83.2">What is my mission?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="84">I'm going to make India [into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.</s>
 <s id="85">In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I'm going to create.</s>
 <s id="86">That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.</s>
 <s id="87">I'm doing something serious.</s>
 <s id="88">If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.</s>
 <s id="89">Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.</s>
 <s id="90">Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.</s>
 <s id="91">Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.</s>
 <p id="p92">
  <s id="92.1">Not in front pocket.</s>
  <s id="92.2">I'm a back pocket man.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p93">
  <s id="93.1">That's all.</s>
  <s id="93.2">A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p94">
  <s id="94.1">I am becoming a solution provider.</s>
  <s id="94.2">I'm very happy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="95">I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.</s>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe.</s>
  <s id="96.2">That's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p97">
  <s id="97.1">Now 110 countries are accessing it.</s>
  <s id="97.2">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="98">So I classify the people into three: uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.</s>
 <p id="p99">
  <s id="99.1">Little educated, done this.</s>
  <s id="99.2">Surplus educated, what are you going to do for the society?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p100">
  <s id="100.1">Thank you very much.</s>
  <s id="100.2">Bye!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="101">(Applause)</s>
