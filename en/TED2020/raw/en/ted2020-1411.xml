 <s id="1">You know, cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.</s>
 <s id="2">For students, it's quite an experience, but for a school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain.</s>
 <s id="3">So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught, they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.</s>
 <s id="4">Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are, cadavers may not be easily available.</s>
 <s id="5">So to address this, we developed with a Dr. Brown in Stanford: virtual dissection table.</s>
 <s id="6">So we call this Anatomage Table.</s>
 <s id="7">So with this Anatomage Table, students can experience the dissection without a human cadaver.</s>
 <s id="8">And the table form is important, and since it's touch-interactive, just like the way they do dissections in the lab, or furthermore just the way a surgeon operates on a patient you can literally interact with your table.</s>
 <s id="9">Our digital body is one-to-one life size, so this is exactly the way students will see the real anatomy.</s>
 <s id="10">I'm going to do some demonstrations.</s>
 <s id="11">As you can see, I use my finger to interact with my digital body.</s>
 <s id="12">I'm going to do some cuts.</s>
 <s id="13">I can cut any way I want to, so I cut right here.</s>
 <s id="14">Then it's going to show inside.</s>
 <s id="15">And I can change my cut to see different parts.</s>
 <s id="16">Maybe I can cut there, see the brain, and I can change my cut.</s>
 <s id="17">You can see some internal organs.</s>
 <s id="18">So we call this the slicer mode.</s>
 <s id="19">OK, I'm going to do another cut.</s>
 <s id="20">Right there.</s>
 <s id="21">This shows a lot of internal structures.</s>
 <s id="22">So if I want to see the back side, I can flip and see from behind.</s>
 <s id="23">Like this.</s>
 <s id="24">So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you, that means we did the right job.</s>
 <s id="25">So our doctors said these are eye candies.</s>
 <s id="26">So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissections.</s>
 <s id="27">What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skin, muscles and bones, just to see a few internal organs.</s>
 <s id="28">Right here.</s>
 <s id="29">Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here.</s>
 <s id="30">OK.</s>
 <s id="31">Let's say I'm interested in looking at the heart.</s>
 <s id="32">I'm going to do some surgery here.</s>
 <s id="33">I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.</s>
 <s id="34">Oops! ...</s>
 <s id="35">You don't want to hear "oops" in real surgery.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) But fortunately, our digital man has "undo."</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) Okay.</s>
 <s id="38">All right then.</s>
 <s id="39">Let me zoom in.</s>
 <s id="40">I'm going to make a cut right there.</s>
 <s id="41">And then you can see the inside of the heart.</s>
 <s id="42">You can see the atrium and the ventricles, how blood flows to our arteries and veins.</s>
 <s id="43">Just like this, students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to.</s>
 <s id="44">It doesn't have to be always dissection.</s>
 <s id="45">Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.</s>
 <s id="46">So let me show you, I'm going to start with the skeletal structure, and I can add a few internal organs.</s>
 <s id="47">Yep.</s>
 <s id="48">Maybe I can add quickly this way.</s>
 <s id="49">And I can build muscles gradually, just like that.</s>
 <s id="50">We can see tendons and muscles.</s>
 <s id="51">Wish I could build my muscle this fast.</s>
 <s id="52">(Laughter) And this is another way to learn anatomy.</s>
 <s id="53">Another thing I can show you is, more often than not, doctors get to meet patients in X-ray form.</s>
 <s id="54">So, Anatomage Table shows exactly how the anatomy will appear in X-ray.</s>
 <s id="55">You can also interact with your X-ray, and also if you want, you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray, too.</s>
 <s id="56">So when you are done, just bring back the body and then it's ready for another session.</s>
 <s id="57">It looks like our table also can transform gender, too.</s>
 <s id="58">It's a female now.</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">So this is Anatomage Table.</s>
  <s id="59.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">(Applause)</s>
