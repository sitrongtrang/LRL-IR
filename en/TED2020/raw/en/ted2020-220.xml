 <s id="1">My name is Joseph, a Member of Parliament in Kenya.</s>
 <s id="2">Picture a Maasai village, and one evening, government soldiers come, surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school.</s>
 <s id="3">That's how I went to school -- pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father, "You have to make a choice."</s>
 <s id="4">I walked very comfortably to this missionary school, that was run by an American missionary.</s>
 <s id="5">The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.</s>
 <s id="6">I had never in my life ever tasted candy.</s>
 <s id="7">So I said to myself, with all these hundred other boys, this is where I belong.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) I stayed.</s>
 <s id="9">When everybody else was dropping out.</s>
 <s id="10">My family moved; we're nomads.</s>
 <s id="11">It was a boarding school, I was seven -- Every time it closed you had to travel to find them.</s>
 <s id="12">40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.</s>
 <s id="13">You slept in the bush, but you kept going.</s>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">And I stayed.</s>
  <s id="14.2">I don't know why, but I did.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">All of a sudden I passed the national examination, found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.</s>
 <s id="16">And I finished high school.</s>
 <s id="17">And just walking, I found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States.</s>
 <s id="18">My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut, none of my brothers were going to school, and this man told me, "Here, go."</s>
 <s id="19">I got a scholarship to St. Lawrence University, Upstate New York; finished that.</s>
 <s id="20">And after that I went to Harvard Graduate School; finished that.</s>
 <s id="21">Then I worked in DC a little bit: I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history.</s>
 <s id="22">And every time, I kept going back home, listening to their problems -- sick people, people with no water, all this stuff -- every time I go back to America, I kept thinking about them.</s>
 <s id="23">Then one day, an elder gave me a story that went like this: long time ago, there was a big war between tribes.</s>
 <s id="24">This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.</s>
 <s id="25">Every time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">So one day, the scouts came running and told the villagers, "The enemies are coming.</s>
  <s id="26.2">Only half an hour away, they'll be here."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">So people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out.</s>
 <s id="28">But there were two men: one man was blind, one man had no legs -- he was born like that.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry.</s>
  <s id="29.2">We can't take you.</s>
  <s id="29.3">You'll slow us down.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">We have to flee our women and children, we have to run."</s>
 <s id="31">And they were left behind, waiting to die.</s>
 <s id="32">But these two people worked something out.</s>
 <s id="33">The blind man said, "Look, I'm a very strong man but I can't see."</s>
 <s id="34">The man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world, but I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."</s>
 <s id="35">The blind man went down on his knees like this, and told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up.</s>
 <s id="36">The man on top can see, the blind man can walk.</s>
 <s id="37">These guys took off, followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them.</s>
 <s id="38">So, this was told to me in a setup of elders.</s>
 <s id="39">And it's a really poor area.</s>
 <s id="40">I represent Northern Kenya: the most nomadic, remote areas you can even find.</s>
 <s id="41">And that man told me, "So, here you are.</s>
 <s id="42">You've got a good education from America, you have a good life in America; what are you going to do for us?</s>
 <s id="43">We want you to be our eyes, we'll give you the legs.</s>
 <s id="44">We'll walk you, you lead us."</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">The opportunity came.</s>
  <s id="45.2">I was always thinking about that: "What can I do to help my people?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence, we still don't have basic health facilities.</s>
 <s id="47">A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.</s>
 <s id="48">No clean drinking water.</s>
 <s id="49">So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.</s>
 <s id="50">I'm leaving America.</s>
 <s id="51">I'm going to run for office."</s>
 <s id="52">Last June, I moved from America, ran in July election and won.</s>
 <s id="53">And I came for them, and that's my goal.</s>
 <s id="54">Right now I have in place, for the last nine months, a plan that in five years, every nomad will have clean drinking water.</s>
 <s id="55">We're building dispensaries across that constituency.</s>
 <s id="56">I'm asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.</s>
 <s id="57">I'm trying to improve infrastructure.</s>
 <s id="58">I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community to move them forward.</s>
 <s id="59">I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues because people from outside can come and help us, but if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing to do.</s>
 <s id="60">My plan right now as I continue with introducing students to different fields -- some become doctors, some lawyers -- we want to produce a comprehensive group of people, students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession.</s>
 <s id="61">As I continue to be a Member of Parliament and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany, health, democracy, new inventions, I'm hoping that one day in my own little community -- which is 26,000 square km, maybe five times Rhode Island -- with no roads, we'll be able to become a model to help others develop.</s>
 <s id="62">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="63">(Applause)</s>
