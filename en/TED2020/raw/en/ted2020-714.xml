 <s id="1">There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money.</s>
 <s id="2">In fact, they make their living on this stuff.</s>
 <s id="3">I'm going to try to save you all the time and money and go through it in the next three minutes, so bear with me.</s>
 <s id="4">Started a website in 2005 with a few friends, called Reddit.com.</s>
 <s id="5">It's what you'd call a social news website; basically, the democratic front page of the best stuff on the web.</s>
 <s id="6">You find some interesting content -- say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit, and a community of your peers votes up if they like it, down if they don't.</s>
 <s id="7">That creates the front page.</s>
 <s id="8">It's always rising, falling; a half million people visit every day.</s>
 <s id="9">But this isn't about Reddit.</s>
 <s id="10">It's about discovering new things that pop up on the web.</s>
 <s id="11">In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes, all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.</s>
 <s id="12">This isn't about Reddit itself, it's actually about humpback whales.</s>
 <s id="13">Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace, an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government's whaling campaign.</s>
 <s id="14">The whales were getting killed; they wanted to put an end to it.</s>
 <s id="15">One of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of the whales.</s>
 <s id="16">But to personify the movement, they wanted to name it.</s>
 <s id="17">So in true web fashion, they put together a poll, where they had a bunch of very erudite, very thoughtful, cultured names.</s>
 <s id="18">I believe this is the Farsi word for "immortal."</s>
 <s id="19">I think this means "divine power of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.</s>
 <s id="20">And then there was this: "Mister Splashy Pants."</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) And this was a special name.</s>
 <s id="22">Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends, was very popular on the Internet.</s>
 <s id="23">In fact, someone on Reddit thought, "What a great thing, we should all vote this up."</s>
 <s id="24">And Redditors responded and all agreed.</s>
 <s id="25">So the voting started.</s>
 <s id="26">We got behind it ourselves; we changed our logo for the day, from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause.</s>
 <s id="27">And it wasn't long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"</s>
 <s id="28">So it went from about five percent, which was when this meme started, to 70 percent at the end of voting.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">Pretty impressive, right?</s>
  <s id="29.2">We won!</s>
  <s id="29.3">Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">Just kidding -- Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it, because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">They said, "No, just kidding.</s>
  <s id="31.2">We'll give it another week of voting."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Well, that got us a little angry, so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) And the Reddit community -- really, the rest of the Internet, really got behind this.</s>
 <s id="34">Facebook groups were created.</s>
 <s id="35">Facebook applications were created.</s>
 <s id="36">The idea was, "Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants."</s>
 <s id="37">People were putting up signs in the real world about this whale.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) This was the final vote: 78 percent of the votes.</s>
 <s id="39">To give you an idea of the landslide, the next highest name pulled in three.</s>
 <s id="40">There was a clear lesson: the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">Which is obvious.</s>
  <s id="41.2">It's a great name.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) I think that's what helped drive this.</s>
 <s id="44">What was cool were the repercussions.</s>
 <s id="45">Greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it -- Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins, an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.</s>
 <s id="46">But even more important was that they accomplished their mission.</s>
 <s id="47">The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition.</s>
 <s id="48">Mission accomplished: Greenpeace was thrilled, the whales were happy -- that's a quote.</s>
 <s id="49">(Laughter) And actually, Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers.</s>
 <s id="50">A few, certainly, but we're talking about a lot of people, really interested and caught up in this meme.</s>
 <s id="51">Greenpeace came back to the site and thanked Reddit for its participation.</s>
 <s id="52">But this wasn't really altruism; just interest in doing something cool.</s>
 <p id="p53">
  <s id="53.1">This is how the Internet works.</s>
  <s id="53.2">This is that great big secret.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="54">The Internet provides a level playing field.</s>
 <s id="55">Your link is as good as your link, which is as good as my link.</s>
 <s id="56">With a browser, anyone can get to any website no matter your budget.</s>
 <s id="57">That is, as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.</s>
 <s id="58">Another important thing is it costs nothing to get content online.</s>
 <s id="59">There are so many publishing tools available, it only takes a few minutes to produce something.</s>
 <s id="60">and the cost of iteration is so cheap, you might as well.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">If you do, be genuine.</s>
  <s id="61.2">Be honest, up-front.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">One of the great lessons Greenpeace learned is that it's OK to lose control, OK to take yourself a little less seriously, given that, even though it's a very serious cause, you could ultimately achieve your goal.</s>
 <s id="63">That's the final message I want to share: you can do well online.</s>
 <s id="64">But no longer is the message coming from just the top down.</s>
 <s id="65">If you want to succeed you've got to be OK to lose control.</s>
 <s id="66">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="67">(Applause)</s>
