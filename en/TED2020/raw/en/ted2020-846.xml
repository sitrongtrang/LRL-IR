 <s id="1">If you go on the TED website, you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos, over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings.</s>
 <s id="2">And that's a huge amount of data.</s>
 <s id="3">And it got me wondering: If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?</s>
 <s id="4">Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk?</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) (Applause) And also, could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with?</s>
 <s id="6">To find this out, I looked at three things: I looked at the topic that you should choose, I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose, but you should choose wisely, because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk.</s>
 <s id="8">Now, to make this more concrete, let's look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks.</s>
 <s id="9">So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains, that's a go.</s>
 <s id="10">(Laughter) (Applause) Whereas, if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen, girls, aircraft -- actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter) but statistics say it's not so good.</s>
 <s id="11">Oh, well.</s>
 <s id="12">If you generalize this, the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with, both easily and deeply, such as happiness, our own body, food, emotions.</s>
 <s id="13">And the more technical topics, such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men, those are not good topics to talk about.</s>
 <s id="14">How should you deliver your talk?</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock, so they're going to hate me for revealing this, because, actually, you should talk as long as they will let you.</s>
  <s id="15.2">(Laughter) Because the most favorite TEDTalks are, on average, over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Then, you should be brief.</s>
  <s id="17.2">(Laughter) But other than that, talk until they drag you off the stage.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) Now, while ...</s>
 <s id="19">(Applause) While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.</s>
 <s id="20">I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.</s>
 <s id="21">I'll give you three examples.</s>
 <s id="22">First of all, I must, as a speaker, provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you, instead of saying what I can't have.</s>
 <s id="23">Secondly, it's imperative that you do not cite The New York Times.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news -- to fake intellectual capacity.</s>
 <s id="25">If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."</s>
 <s id="26">You'll all stay with me.</s>
 <s id="27">It's perfectly fine.</s>
 <s id="28">(Applause) Now, let's go to the visuals.</s>
 <s id="29">The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.</s>
 <s id="30">And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers, you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average, make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker.</s>
 <s id="31">Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.</s>
 <s id="32">And now the most important thing, that is the mood onstage.</s>
 <s id="33">Color plays a very important role.</s>
 <s id="34">Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website.</s>
 <s id="35">(Applause) For example, fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color, (Laughter) much more than the average TEDTalk.</s>
 <s id="36">Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color, etc., et.</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) (Applause) Now, personally, I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis, but I'll leave this to your good judgment.</s>
 <s id="38">So, now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk.</s>
 <s id="39">Now, since this is TEDActive, and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something, I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you, but rather give you a tool to create your own.</s>
 <s id="40">And I call this tool the TEDPad.</s>
 <s id="41">(Laughter) And the TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected, highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.</s>
 <s id="42">You only have to make one decision, and that is: Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks, about creativity, human genius?</s>
 <s id="43">Or are you going to go with a black version, which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks, mostly about blogs, politics and stuff?</s>
 <s id="44">So, download it and have fun with it.</s>
 <s id="45">Now I hope you enjoy the session.</s>
 <s id="46">I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.</s>
 <s id="47">And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this, which I really want to see.</s>
 <s id="48">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="49">(Applause) Thanks.</s>
