 <s id="1">You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s secret vault, secured by a series of combination locks.</s>
 <s id="2">Fortunately, your treasure map has three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm.</s>
 <s id="3">The last one appears to be missing.</s>
 <s id="4">Looks like you’re gonna have to figure it out on your own.</s>
 <s id="5">There’s something those first two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called autobiographical numbers.</s>
 <s id="6">This is a special type of number whose structure describes itself.</s>
 <s id="7">Each of an autobiographical number’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that position occurs within the number.</s>
 <s id="8">The first digit indicates the quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates the number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, and so on until the end.</s>
 <s id="9">The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit autobiographical number.</s>
 <s id="10">What is it?</s>
 <s id="11">Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself!</s>
 <s id="12">Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations would take forever.</s>
 <s id="13">So let’s analyze the autobiographical numbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find.</s>
 <s id="14">By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits.</s>
 <s id="15">This makes sense since each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific digit occurs within the total.</s>
 <s id="16">So the digits in our ten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten.</s>
 <s id="17">This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have too many large digits.</s>
 <s id="18">For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would have to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits.</s>
 <s id="19">We can conclude that there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 in the entire sequence.</s>
 <s id="20">So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut.</s>
 <s id="21">And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers that aren’t used.</s>
 <s id="22">So now we know that our number must contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading digit must be 3 or greater.</s>
 <s id="23">Now, while this first digit counts the number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times a particular non-zero digit occurs.</s>
 <s id="24">If we add together all the digits besides the first one – and remember, zeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many non-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit.</s>
 <s id="25">For example, if we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits.</s>
 <s id="26">Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero digits there are after the first digit – two, in our example.</s>
 <s id="27">Why go through all that?</s>
 <s id="28">Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits that occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, minus one.</s>
 <s id="29">And how can you get a distribution where the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero positive integers being added together?</s>
 <s id="30">The only way is for one of the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s.</s>
 <s id="31">How many 1s?</s>
 <s id="32">Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional digits like 3 or 4 to count them.</s>
 <s id="33">So now we have the leading digit of 3 or greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit.</s>
 <s id="34">And speaking of that, it’s time to find out what the leading digit is.</s>
 <s id="35">Since we know that the 2 and the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6.</s>
 <s id="36">Now it’s just a matter of putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines.</s>
 <s id="37">The safe swings open, and inside you find...</s>
 <s id="38">Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.</s>
