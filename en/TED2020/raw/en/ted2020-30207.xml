 <s id="1">You’ve discovered a doorway to another realm, and now you and your brother are off exploring the wonderful world of Paradoxica.</s>
 <s id="2">Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl, run, and fly around you.</s>
 <s id="3">And then you see the troll.</s>
 <s id="4">It’s catching all the creatures in an enormous net.</s>
 <s id="5">You bravely step forward and demand it let them go.</s>
 <s id="6">The troll laughs.</s>
 <s id="7">“If you’re such a fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I’ll make you an offer.</s>
 <s id="8">If you say something true, I’ll release all these creatures."</s>
 <s id="9">You’re about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can, the troll grabs your brother.</s>
 <s id="10">“If you say something false,” he continues, “then I’ll release your brother."</s>
 <s id="11">Your statement can only be a single sentence.</s>
 <s id="12">And as you can see, I hate paradoxes more than anything.</s>
 <s id="13">If you try to cheat by saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother and the creatures."</s>
 <s id="14">What true/false statement can you say to force the troll to free your brother and the paradoxical creatures?</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">[Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself!]</s>
  <s id="15.2">Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to release all its prisoners.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician and puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan.</s>
 <s id="17">The trick Smullyan came up with involves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on what you want the troll to do.</s>
 <s id="18">Your statement still has to be carefully crafted.</s>
 <p id="p19">
  <s id="19.1">For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the creatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… I’m only going to free your brother.”</s>
  <s id="19.2">Similarly, if you said, “You will free the paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” and free the paradoxes.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">But watch what happens if you say, “You will free my brother.”</s>
  <s id="20.2">The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, by its own rules, would have to free your brother.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">That would make the statement paradoxically true and false.</s>
 <s id="22">But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one.</s>
 <s id="23">So his only option is for the statement to be true.</s>
 <s id="24">If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll has to release your brother.</s>
 <s id="25">And by its own rules, the troll has to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement.</s>
 <s id="26">By wielding just 5 words like a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll to free all its prisoners.</s>
 <s id="27">As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you for winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the treasure at the top of the stairs.</s>
 <s id="28">If you can reach it.</s>
