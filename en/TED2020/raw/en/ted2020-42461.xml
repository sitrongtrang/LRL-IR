  <s id="1.1">"The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles.</s>
  <s id="1.2">From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.</s>

  <s id="2.1">“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she With silent lips.</s>
  <s id="2.2">“Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</s>

 <s id="3">Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”</s>
