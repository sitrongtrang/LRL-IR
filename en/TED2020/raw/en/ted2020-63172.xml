 <s id="1">Raise your hand, and be honest, if you've used the phrase "crazy busy" to describe your day, your week, your month.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm an emergency-room doctor, and "crazy busy" is a phrase you will never hear me use.</s>
 <s id="3">And after today, I hope you'll stop using it, too.</s>
 <s id="4">Here's why you cannot afford to use "crazy" to describe your busy.</s>
 <s id="5">Because when we are in what I refer to as Crazy Busy Mode, we are simply less capable of handling the busy.</s>
 <s id="6">Here's what happens.</s>
 <s id="7">Your stress hormones rise and stay there, your executive function in the prefrontal cortex declines.</s>
 <s id="8">That means your memory, your judgment, your impulse control deteriorate, and the brain areas for anger and anxiety are activated.</s>
 <s id="9">Do you feel that?</s>
 <s id="10">Here's the thing.</s>
 <s id="11">You can be as busy as an emergency department without feeling like you're crazy busy.</s>
 <s id="12">How?</s>
 <s id="13">By using the same tactics that we use.</s>
 <s id="14">Our brains all process stress in similar fundamental ways.</s>
 <s id="15">But how we react to it has been shown by research to be modifiable, whether it's emergencies or just daily, day-in, day-out stress.</s>
 <s id="16">Now contrast Crazy Busy Mode with how I think of us in the ER -- Ready Mode.</s>
 <s id="17">Ready Mode means whatever comes in through those doors, whether it's a multiple-car pileup, or a patient having chest pain while stuck in an elevator, or another patient with an item stuck where it shouldn't be.</s>
 <s id="18">When you're know you're dying to ask.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) Even on those days when you would swear you were being punked, we're not afraid of it.</s>
 <s id="20">Because we know that whatever comes in through those ER double doors, that we can handle it.</s>
 <s id="21">That we're ready.</s>
 <s id="22">That's Ready Mode.</s>
 <s id="23">We've trained for it, and you can, too.</s>
 <s id="24">Here's how.</s>
 <s id="25">Step one to go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode is to relentlessly triage.</s>
 <s id="26">In Crazy Mode, you're always busy, always stressed, because you're reacting to every challenge with the same response.</s>
 <s id="27">Contrast that with Ready Mode, where we triage, which means we prioritize by degree of urgency.</s>
 <s id="28">This isn't just a nice way to get your to-do list done.</s>
 <s id="29">Work by Dr. Robert Sapolsky shows that individuals who cannot differentiate threat from non-threat and react to everything with the same response have double the level of stress hormones.</s>
 <s id="30">Which is why this is the first skill to learn.</s>
 <s id="31">You can't take care of them all at once, but you don't have to.</s>
 <s id="32">Because we triage.</s>
 <s id="33">Red -- immediately life-threatening.</s>
 <s id="34">Yellow -- serious, but not immediately life-threatening.</s>
 <s id="35">Green -- minor.</s>
 <s id="36">And we focus our efforts first on the reds.</s>
 <s id="37">Now hear this.</s>
 <s id="38">Part of the problem in Crazy Mode is that you are reacting to everything as if it is red.</s>
 <s id="39">So start by triaging correctly.</s>
 <s id="40">Know your reds.</s>
 <s id="41">They're what is most important and where you can most move the needle.</s>
 <s id="42">Now it's easy to be confused by noise, but what it noisiest is not always what is most red.</s>
 <s id="43">In fact, my severe asthmatic patient is most at risk when he's quiet.</s>
 <s id="44">But my patient over here, demanding that I bring her flavored coffee creamer, she's noisy, but she's not red.</s>
 <s id="45">I'll give you an example from my own life.</s>
 <s id="46">Last spring, my house flooded, my one-year-old was in the ER, I was supposed to do a fundraiser for my four-year-old's school and the final chapter of my book was beyond late.</s>
 <s id="47">Maybe not ironically, that was the chapter on stress.</s>
 <s id="48">(Laughter) My red tasks were getting my one-year-old better and finishing my book.</s>
 <s id="49">That was it.</s>
 <s id="50">Remember, relentlessly triage.</s>
 <s id="51">The house flood repair?</s>
 <s id="52">Well, once we had stopped and stabilized the damage, it was no longer a red.</s>
 <s id="53">It felt red, but it was in fact just noise.</s>
 <s id="54">No, no really, it was quite noisy, this picture on the far right is me wearing earplugs to focus on my book, while the floor is being mechanically dried around me.</s>
 <s id="55">Know your reds, and do not let your non-reds distract you from them.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">By the way, it is liberating with a green task to, every once in a while, be able to remind yourself, "That's a green task.</s>
  <s id="56.2">No one's going to die."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">(Laughter) It's OK if it's not perfect.</s>
 <s id="58">Now there's one last triage level that we use in the worst scenarios.</s>
 <s id="59">And that is black.</s>
 <s id="60">Those patients for whom there is nothing we can do.</s>
 <s id="61">Where we must move on.</s>
 <s id="62">And although it is gut-wrenching, I mention it, because you each have your own equivalent black tasks in your life.</s>
 <s id="63">These are items that you must take off your list.</s>
 <s id="64">And I think many of you know what I'm talking about.</s>
 <s id="65">For me, this was the fundraiser.</s>
 <s id="66">I had to step down.</s>
 <s id="67">Because as we in the ER know, if you try to do everything, you have no hope of saving your reds.</s>
 <s id="68">Step two to go from Crazy Mode into Ready Mode is to expect and design for crazy.</s>
 <s id="69">Half of handling crazy is how you prepare for it.</s>
 <s id="70">So if step one we triage, step two, we design to make those tasks easier to do.</s>
 <s id="71">Science shows us that the more options we have, then the longer each decision takes.</s>
 <s id="72">And the more decisions we have to make, the more exhausted our brain gets and the less it is capable of making good decisions.</s>
 <s id="73">Which is why this step two is about finding ways to reduce your daily decisions.</s>
 <s id="74">Here are four easy examples you can use in your daily lifestyle.</s>
 <s id="75">Plan.</s>
 <s id="76">Plan your entire week's meals on the weekend, so that when it's Wednesday at 6pm and everyone's hangry and requesting pizza, you have no decisions to make to get a healthy meal on the table.</s>
 <s id="77">Automate.</s>
 <s id="78">Never leave anything to remember that you could automate, whether it's scheduling it as recurring or saved list, or recurrent purchases.</s>
 <s id="79">Colocate.</s>
 <s id="80">When it comes to exercise, store all the equipment that you need for a certain activity together, charged and ready, so you don't spend energy looking for it.</s>
 <s id="81">And decrease temptations, for anyone driven by sugar cravings.</s>
 <s id="82">Anyone?</s>
 <s id="83">Say aye, go ahead.</s>
 <s id="84">That itself is its own form of Crazy Mode and self-medication for Crazy Mode, but stop working your willpower.</s>
 <s id="85">Design differently.</s>
 <s id="86">If a food is out of immediate reach, such that you have to use a stool to reach it, even when it's chocolate, study participants ate 70 percent less without thinking about it.</s>
 <s id="87">I know.</s>
 <s id="88">Let that sit for a second.</s>
 <s id="89">(Laughter) Design to make the choices you wish to make easier.</s>
 <s id="90">Which bring us to the third step to go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode, and that is to get out of your head.</s>
 <s id="91">Come with me.</s>
 <s id="92">Different story.</s>
 <s id="93">I'm working in a small, satellite ER, when a woman comes in in labor.</s>
 <s id="94">I realize that the cord is wrapped not once but twice around the baby's neck.</s>
 <s id="95">And I'm the only doctor.</s>
 <s id="96">I was scared.</s>
 <s id="97">But I couldn't let it derail me.</s>
 <s id="98">Because, you see, we all get nervous.</s>
 <s id="99">We all get scared, but it's what you do next that matters.</s>
 <s id="100">That first feeling isn't the problem.</s>
 <s id="101">It can be an important sign.</s>
 <s id="102">The problem comes when we let it derail us.</s>
 <s id="103">When that internal monologue starts and we catastrophize and we start to get that tunnel vision.</s>
 <s id="104">That's how you think when you're in Crazy Mode, and you cannot solve anything that way.</s>
 <s id="105">Now I promise to come back to the story, but first, how do I get out of my own head?</s>
 <s id="106">There are many tactics that you may hear, but for me, I find it best in the moment to actively put my focus on someone else.</s>
 <s id="107">To deliberately make myself see the person in front of me, see myself in the arena with them -- what do they need, what do they fear and how can I help?</s>
 <s id="108">This may sound like a whole lot of warm and fuzzy to you, but it's not.</s>
 <s id="109">In fact, research shows that when you prime your brain with what is, essentially, compassion, we disrupt that tunnel vision and internal monologue.</s>
 <s id="110">You widen your perception, so your brain can actually take in broader information, so you see more possibilities and can make better decisions.</s>
 <s id="111">Try it.</s>
 <s id="112">Know that your internal monologue can derail you.</s>
 <s id="113">And realize that when you get out of your own head, you get out of your own way.</s>
 <s id="114">Now what happened to that baby?</s>
 <s id="115">I focused not on my fear, but on the mother and the baby and what they needed me to do.</s>
 <s id="116">And got the cord off of the baby's neck, and a healthy screaming, kicking baby arrived, just as the dad ran in from the parking lot, "Hi, you have a son, I'm Dr. Darria.</s>
 <s id="117">Congratulations, you want to cut the cord?"</s>
 <s id="118">(Laughter) And for a moment, the strong cries of a newborn drowned out the beeps and the sirens that are the normal sounds of the ER.</s>
 <s id="119">But there was also something else.</s>
 <s id="120">Because when I walked back out of that mother's room, I saw several of my other patients hovering nearby.</s>
 <s id="121">I suddenly realized that despite their own problems that had brought them to the emergency room, they had all come together to root for this baby.</s>
 <s id="122">And they now together shared in the joy.</s>
 <s id="123">Because that is what happens when you go from Crazy Mode to Ready Mode.</s>
 <s id="124">Others notice.</s>
 <s id="125">They want it too, they just don't know how, they just need one example.</s>
 <s id="126">Which could be you.</s>
 <s id="127">Own the busy.</s>
 <s id="128">But stop calling it crazy.</s>
 <s id="129">You've always had that ability.</s>
 <s id="130">But now ...</s>
 <s id="131">you're ready.</s>
 <s id="132">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="133">(Applause)</s>
