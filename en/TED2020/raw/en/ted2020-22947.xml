 <s id="1">Five years ago, I stood on the TED stage, and I spoke about my work.</s>
 <s id="2">But one year later, I had a terrible accident as I left a pub one dark night with friends, in Scotland.</s>
 <s id="3">As we followed the path through a forest, I suddenly felt a massive thud, then a second thud, and I fell to the ground.</s>
 <s id="4">I had no idea what had hit me.</s>
 <s id="5">I later found out that when the gate was opened on a garden, a wild stag stampeded along the path and ran straight into me.</s>
 <s id="6">Its antler penetrated my trachea and my esophagus and stopped at my spinal cord and fractured my neck.</s>
 <s id="7">My best friend found me lying on the floor, gurgling for help through a hole in my neck.</s>
 <s id="8">And we locked eyes, and although I couldn't speak, she could understand what I was thinking.</s>
 <s id="9">And she told me, "Just breathe."</s>
 <s id="10">And so, whilst focusing on my breath, I had a strong sense of calmness, but I was certain that I was going to die.</s>
 <s id="11">Somehow, I was content with this, because I've always tried to do my best in life whenever I can.</s>
 <s id="12">So I just continued to enjoy each breath as one more moment -- one breath in and one breath out.</s>
 <s id="13">An ambulance came, I was still fully conscious, and I analyzed everything on the journey, because I'm a scientist: the sound of the tires on the road, the frequency of the street lights and eventually, the city street lights.</s>
 <s id="14">And I thought, "Maybe I will survive."</s>
 <s id="15">And then I passed out.</s>
 <s id="16">I was stabilized at a local hospital and then airlifted to Glasgow, where they reconstructed my throat and put me in a coma.</s>
 <s id="17">And while I was in the coma, I had many alternate realities.</s>
 <s id="18">It was like a crazy mix of "Westworld" and "Black Mirror."</s>
 <s id="19">But that's a whole other story.</s>
 <s id="20">My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.</s>
 <s id="21">And a week later, I woke up from that coma.</s>
 <s id="22">And that was the first gift.</s>
 <s id="23">Then I had the gift to think, the gift to move, the gift to breathe and the gift to eat and to drink.</s>
 <s id="24">That took three and a half months.</s>
 <s id="25">But there was one thing that I never got back, though, and that was my privacy.</s>
 <s id="26">The tabloid press made the story about gender.</s>
 <s id="27">Look -- I'm transgender, it's not that big a deal.</s>
 <s id="28">Like, my hair color or my shoe size is way more interesting.</s>
 <s id="29">When I last spoke here -- (Applause) When I last spoke here -- (Applause) at TED, I didn't talk about it, because it's boring.</s>
 <s id="30">And one Scottish newspaper ran with the headline: "Sex Swap Scientist Gored by Stag."</s>
 <s id="31">And five others did similar things.</s>
 <s id="32">And for a minute, I was angry.</s>
 <s id="33">But then I found my calm place.</s>
 <s id="34">And what ran through my head was, "They've crossed the wrong woman, and they're not going to know what's hit them."</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) I'm a kindness ninja.</s>
 <s id="36">I don't really know what a ninja does, but to me, they slip through the shadows, crawl through the sewers, skip across the rooftops, and before you know it, they're behind you.</s>
 <s id="37">They don't turn up with an army or complain, and they're laser-focused on a plan.</s>
 <s id="38">So when I lay in my hospital bed, I thought of my plan to help reduce the chances of them doing this to somebody else, by using the system as is, and paying the price of sacrificing my privacy.</s>
 <s id="39">What they told one million people, I will tell 10 million people.</s>
 <s id="40">Because when you're angry, people defend themselves.</s>
 <s id="41">So I didn't attack them, and they were defenseless.</s>
 <s id="42">I wrote kind and calm letters to these newspapers.</s>
 <s id="43">And The Sun newspaper, the kind of "Fox News" of the UK, thanked me for my "reasoned approach."</s>
 <s id="44">I asked for no apology, no retraction, no money, just an acknowledgment that they broke their own rules, and what they did was just wrong.</s>
 <s id="45">And on this journey, I started to learn who they are, and they began to learn who I am.</s>
 <s id="46">And we actually became friends.</s>
 <s id="47">I've even had a few glasses of wine with Philippa from The Sun since then.</s>
 <s id="48">And after three months, they all agreed, and the statements were published on a Friday, and that was the end of that.</s>
 <s id="49">Or so they thought.</s>
 <s id="50">On the Saturday, I went on the evening news, with the headline "Six National Newspapers Admit They Were Wrong."</s>
 <s id="51">And the anchor said to me, "But don't you think it's our job as journalists to sensationalize a story?"</s>
 <s id="52">And I said, "I was laying on a forest floor, gored by a stag.</s>
 <s id="53">Is that not sensational enough?"</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) And I was now writing the headlines.</s>
 <s id="55">My favorite one was, "The stag trampled on my throat, and the press trampled on my privacy."</s>
 <s id="56">It was the most read piece of BBC News online that day.</s>
 <s id="57">And I was kind of having fun.</s>
 <s id="58">And by the end of my week of media, I started to use my newfound voice and platform to spread a message of love and kindness.</s>
 <s id="59">And when I had the minute of anger and hatred towards those press and journalists, I had to identify my inner bigotry towards them.</s>
 <s id="60">And I had to meet and speak with these people without judgment.</s>
 <s id="61">I had to let myself understand them, and in return, they began to understand me.</s>
 <s id="62">Well, six months later, they asked me to join the committee that regulates the press.</s>
 <s id="63">And a few times a year, I sip tea and dip biscuits with the likes of Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, who says to me, "So, Kate, how have your last few months been?"</s>
 <s id="64">And I respect them.</s>
 <s id="65">And I'm now one of three members of the public who has a seat at the table -- not because I'm different, but because my voice counts, just like anybody else.</s>
 <s id="66">And the irony is, every now and again, I'm asked to visit those printing presses of this declining industry, because some people think that the technology I spoke about here, last time at TED, my interactive print, might actually help save them.</s>
 <s id="67">So beware of your inner bigot, and make friends from your enemies.</s>
 <s id="68">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="69">(Applause)</s>
