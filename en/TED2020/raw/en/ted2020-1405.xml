 <s id="1">Marco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment.</s>
 <s id="2">Today's its debut.</s>
 <s id="3">It's a demonstration of augmented reality.</s>
 <s id="4">And the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.</s>
 <s id="5">They are live and reacting to me in real time.</s>
 <s id="6">I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.</s>
 <s id="7">So fingers crossed.</s>
 <s id="8">And keep your eyes on the big screen.</s>
 <s id="9">Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery.</s>
 <s id="10">It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask, why, in a technological age, we continue to have this magical sense of wonder.</s>
 <s id="11">Magic is deception, but it is a deception we enjoy.</s>
 <s id="12">To enjoy being deceived, an audience must first suspend its disbelief.</s>
 <s id="13">It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.</s>
 <s id="14">Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.</s>
 <s id="15">MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.</s>
 <s id="16">Without it, a script is just words.</s>
 <s id="17">Augmented reality is just the latest technology.</s>
 <s id="18">And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity.</s>
 <s id="19">We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.</s>
 <s id="20">We do it every day, while reading novels, watching television or going to the movies.</s>
 <s id="21">We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had.</s>
 <s id="22">Without this ability there is no magic.</s>
 <s id="23">It was Jean Robert-Houdin, France's greatest illusionist, who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller.</s>
 <s id="24">He said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.</s>
 <s id="25">Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.</s>
 <s id="26">He is an actor playing the part of a magician.</s>
 <s id="27">MT: Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story.</s>
 <s id="28">The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction.</s>
 <s id="29">There are tales of creation and loss, death and resurrection, and obstacles that must be overcome.</s>
 <s id="30">Now many of them are intensely dramatic.</s>
 <s id="31">Magicians play with fire and steel, defy the fury of the buzzsaw, dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape.</s>
 <s id="32">But audiences don't come to see the magician die, they come to see him live.</s>
 <s id="33">Because the best stories always have a happy ending.</s>
 <s id="34">The tricks of magic have one special element.</s>
 <s id="35">They are stories with a twist.</s>
 <s id="36">Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines.</s>
 <s id="37">He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think.</s>
 <s id="38">Edward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error.</s>
 <s id="39">The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable, but do not, in fact, match what is being done in front of them.</s>
 <s id="40">MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.</s>
 <s id="41">Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination.</s>
 <s id="42">But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected, we laugh.</s>
 <s id="43">The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks.</s>
 <s id="44">The finale defies logic, gives new insight into the problem, and audiences express their amazement with laughter.</s>
 <s id="45">It's fun to be fooled.</s>
 <s id="46">One of the key qualities of all stories is that they're made to be shared.</s>
 <s id="47">We feel compelled to tell them.</s>
 <s id="48">When I do a trick at a party -- (Laughter) that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again.</s>
 <s id="49">They want to share the experience.</s>
 <s id="50">That makes my job more difficult, because, if I want to surprise them, I need to tell a story that starts the same, but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist.</s>
 <s id="51">It keeps me busy.</s>
 <s id="52">Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.</s>
 <s id="53">We think in narrative structures.</s>
 <s id="54">We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood.</s>
 <s id="55">It's a uniquely human achievement.</s>
 <s id="56">We all want to share our stories, whether it is the trick we saw at the party, the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.</s>
 <s id="57">Today, thanks to technology, we can share those stories as never before, by email, Facebook, blogs, tweets, on TED.com.</s>
 <s id="58">The tools of social networking, these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story.</s>
 <s id="59">We turn facts into similes and metaphors, and even fantasies.</s>
 <s id="60">We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole.</s>
 <s id="61">Our stories make us the people we are and, sometimes, the people we want to be.</s>
 <s id="62">They give us our identity and a sense of community.</s>
 <s id="63">And if the story is a good one, it might even make us smile.</s>
 <s id="64">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="65">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="66">(Applause)</s>
