 <s id="1">My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust, protect user rights and keep users safe, both from each other and, at times, from themselves.</s>
 <s id="2">Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.</s>
 <s id="3">Back in January 2009, we saw more than two million new tweets each day on the platform.</s>
 <s id="4">January 2014, more than 500 million.</s>
 <s id="5">We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes.</s>
 <s id="6">That's a 24,900-percent increase.</s>
 <s id="7">Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.</s>
 <s id="8">There's no risk involved.</s>
 <s id="9">My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.</s>
 <s id="10">Sounds straightforward, right?</s>
 <s id="11">You might even think it'd be easy, given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.</s>
 <s id="12">Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities in innocuous activities?</s>
 <s id="13">Given the scale that Twitter is at, a one-in-a-million chance happens 500 times a day.</s>
 <s id="14">It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale.</s>
 <s id="15">For us, edge cases, those rare situations that are unlikely to occur, are more like norms.</s>
 <s id="16">Say 99.999 percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone.</s>
 <s id="17">There's no threat involved.</s>
 <s id="18">Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef, or tweeting about a concert they're attending, or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.</s>
 <s id="19">After you take out that 99.999 percent, that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150,000 per month.</s>
 <s id="20">The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge.</s>
 <s id="21">You know what else makes my role particularly challenging?</s>
 <s id="22">People do weird things.</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) And I have to figure out what they're doing, why, and whether or not there's risk involved, often without much in terms of context or background.</s>
 <s id="24">I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter -- these are all real examples â€” of situations that at first seemed cut and dried, but the truth of the matter was something altogether different.</s>
 <s id="25">The details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty.</s>
 <s id="26">We'll start off easy.</s>
 <s id="27">["Yo bitch"] If you saw a Tweet that only said this, you might think to yourself, "That looks like abuse."</s>
 <s id="28">After all, why would you want to receive the message, "Yo, bitch."</s>
 <s id="29">Now, I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes, so I knew that "yo, bitch" was also often a common greeting between friends, as well as being a popular "Breaking Bad" reference.</s>
 <s id="30">I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case.</s>
 <s id="31">It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role-playing as dogs.</s>
 <s id="32">(Laughter) And in fact, in that case, it's not only not abusive, it's technically just an accurate greeting.</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) So okay, determining whether or not something is abusive without context, definitely hard.</s>
 <s id="34">Let's look at spam.</s>
 <s id="35">Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior, sending the exact same message to thousands of people.</s>
 <s id="36">While this is a mockup I put together using my account, we see accounts doing this all the time.</s>
 <s id="37">Seems pretty straightforward.</s>
 <s id="38">We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior.</s>
 <s id="39">Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.</s>
 <s id="40">Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it.</s>
 <s id="41">You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">Okay.</s>
  <s id="42.2">Let's make the stakes higher.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior.</s>
 <s id="44">This time it's sending the same message and link.</s>
 <s id="45">This is often indicative of something called phishing, somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website.</s>
 <s id="46">That's pretty clearly not a good thing.</s>
 <s id="47">We want to, and do, suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior.</s>
 <s id="48">So why are the stakes higher for this?</s>
 <s id="49">Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a non-violent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening.</s>
 <s id="50">We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it.</s>
 <s id="51">That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors, and even then, we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate.</s>
 <s id="52">Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against, it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected.</s>
 <s id="53">And that's not just an issue for me, or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.</s>
 <s id="54">It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things.</s>
 <s id="55">So what do I do?</s>
 <s id="56">I pause and I think, how could all of this go horribly wrong?</s>
 <s id="57">I visualize catastrophe.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">And that's hard.</s>
  <s id="58.2">There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that, like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) But you still have to do it, particularly if you're marrying 500 million tweets per day.</s>
 <s id="60">What do I mean by "visualize catastrophe?"</s>
 <s id="61">I try to think of how something as benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death, and what to do to prevent that.</s>
 <s id="62">Which happens to be my next example.</s>
 <s id="63">This is my cat, Eli.</s>
 <s id="64">We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets.</s>
 <s id="65">A picture is worth a thousand words.</s>
 <s id="66">You only get 140 characters.</s>
 <s id="67">You add a photo to your tweet, look at how much more content you've got now.</s>
 <s id="68">There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet.</s>
 <s id="69">My job isn't to think of those.</s>
 <s id="70">It's to think of what could go wrong.</s>
 <s id="71">How could this picture lead to my death?</s>
 <s id="72">Well, here's one possibility.</s>
 <s id="73">There's more in that picture than just a cat.</s>
 <s id="74">There's geodata.</s>
 <s id="75">When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera, there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image.</s>
 <s id="76">In fact, this image also contains the equivalent of this, more specifically, this.</s>
 <s id="77">Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat, but I start by assuming the worst will happen.</s>
 <s id="78">That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter, we made the decision to strip that geodata out.</s>
 <s id="79">(Applause) If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards, I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases.</s>
 <s id="80">Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen, it wouldn't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy.</s>
 <s id="81">(Laughter) It's not.</s>
 <s id="82">The vast majority of interactions I see -- and I see a lot, believe me -- are positive, people reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other.</s>
 <s id="83">It's just that for those of us dealing with scale, for those of us tasked with keeping people safe, we have to assume the worst will happen, because for us, a one-in-a-million chance is pretty good odds.</s>
 <s id="84">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="85">(Applause)</s>
