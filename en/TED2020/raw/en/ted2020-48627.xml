 <s id="1">I have a question for you.</s>
 <s id="2">Anybody in the audience who doesn't have a plastic ID?</s>
 <s id="3">Anybody?</s>
 <s id="4">Well, think about it.</s>
 <s id="5">Plastic is everywhere.</s>
 <s id="6">The buttons on your shirt, your mobile cover, the water from the plastic bottle you just had, plastic money in the wallet, maybe.</s>
 <s id="7">It is interesting how plastic has become an integral part of our lives and how we cannot go one single day without it.</s>
 <s id="8">Do you know what that makes me think?</s>
 <s id="9">How my generation is inheriting not just this legacy but also the problem that comes with it: the problem of what we throw in our oceans.</s>
 <s id="10">Hello, everybody.</s>
 <s id="11">My name is Haaziq Kazi.</s>
 <s id="12">I am 12 years old, and I alone have a plastic debt of roughly 66 tons and counting.</s>
 <s id="13">So, in case you are wondering, What is plastic debt?</s>
 <s id="14">It is the amount of non-cycled plastic which we humans leave behind on this planet.</s>
 <s id="15">How many Indians in the house today?</s>
 <s id="16">Raise your hands, please.</s>
 <s id="17">According to a study, for every person in India, six tons of plastic is not recycled annually.</s>
 <s id="18">Any Americans here?</s>
 <s id="19">Your figures are even more astounding.</s>
 <s id="20">Ninety tons per person of plastic which is not recycled, annually.</s>
 <s id="21">Imagine, in a lifetime, how much plastic is left behind because of us.</s>
 <s id="22">When we die, our bodies go back to Mother Earth, but the plastic debt is left behind as a legacy for the coming generations.</s>
 <s id="23">Did you know that by 2050, we will have as much, or maybe more, plastic in the ocean than fish?</s>
 <s id="24">Speaking of which, every time I see people eating fish, I wonder, "Are they eating fish or plastic?"</s>
 <s id="25">Because the plastic we dispose that ends up in the ocean might have been consumed by the same fish which gets on our plate - talk about the vicious karmic cycle.</s>
 <s id="26">The magnitude of the problem inspired me to do something about this.</s>
 <s id="27">Hence, I came up with an idea of an invention that could help make the oceans a cleaner place: an ocean cleaner called ERVIS.</s>
 <s id="28">ERVIS is an intelligent ship which sucks waste from the ocean surface and cleans it.</s>
 <s id="29">It all started two years back.</s>
 <s id="30">I saw some documentaries and a TED Talk of Boyan Slat about how he wanted to clean the oceans.</s>
 <s id="31">A few days later, as I came home from playing football, my mom asked me to wash my hands, and as I went to the sink to get the dirt off, I observed a whirlpool of water going down the drain.</s>
 <s id="32">An idea came to my mind, and I smiled.</s>
 <s id="33">I drew and created a rough model, a circular ship with saucers attached, a very futuristic design, much like the USS Enterprise from Star Trek.</s>
 <s id="34">Come on, we all love the series.</s>
 <s id="35">Right?</s>
 <s id="36">This was just the first draft.</s>
 <s id="37">The propellers weren't automated, and it only lasted seven seconds in water before coming apart.</s>
 <s id="38">But there it was: my ERVIS, my vision of changing the oceans.</s>
 <s id="39">While guzzling down innumerable cups of hot chocolate - you know, I'm still a kid, no coffee for me - I did some exhaustive research to achieve my vision of ERVIS, which is: first, to clean the current waste floating in the ocean; second, to analyze the data from the waste which we collect; and third, to stop it at source, which is getting disposed by the ships.</s>
 <s id="40">I also realized that a circular shape was not very efficient and that I had to redesign my ship to be more hydrodynamic.</s>
 <s id="41">So I worked with scientists and engineers to create a more bleeding edge model.</s>
 <s id="42">So here's how it works.</s>
 <s id="43">The ship is essentially a large boat powered by solar and renewable natural gas, with various compartments, and saucers surrounding it.</s>
 <s id="44">The saucers float on the surface, gravitate to create a whirlpool to pull the waste towards its center, which is then sent through a tube to various chambers in the ship.</s>
 <s id="45">The chambers include an oil chamber, which collects waste oil.</s>
 <s id="46">The next four chambers are for large, medium, small, and micro-waste, respectively.</s>
 <s id="47">Just imagine ERVIS to be a gigantic vacuum cleaner with many cleaning tubes attached to many dust bags.</s>
 <s id="48">Once the waste enters the chambers, ERVIS analyzes, segregates, and compacts it, and pumps the filtered water back into the oceans, all without harming marine life in the process.</s>
 <s id="49">ERVIS, the ship, is my contribution in making the Earth a better place.</s>
 <s id="50">(Applause) And I hope, in some way, it can inspire you to find your idea which can bring a positive change in the world.</s>
 <s id="51">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="52">(Applause) (Cheers)</s>
