 <s id="1">The next time you see a news report of a hurricane or a tropical storm showing high winds battering trees and houses, ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?"</s>
 <s id="2">Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started more than five billion years ago.</s>
 <s id="3">But, to understand why, we need to understand spin.</s>
 <s id="4">In physics, we talk about two types of motion.</s>
 <s id="5">The first is straight-line motion.</s>
 <s id="6">You push on something, and it moves forward.</s>
 <s id="7">The second type, spin, involves an object rotating, or turning on its axis in place.</s>
 <s id="8">An object in straight-line motion will move forever unless something, like the friction of the ground beneath it, causes it to slow down and stop.</s>
 <s id="9">The same thing happens when you get something spinning.</s>
 <s id="10">It will keep on spinning until something stops it.</s>
 <s id="11">But the spin can speed up.</s>
 <s id="12">If an ice skater is gliding across the ice in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in, she keeps on gliding at the same speed.</s>
 <s id="13">But if she is spinning on the ice and she pulls her arms in, you know what happens next.</s>
 <s id="14">She spins faster.</s>
 <s id="15">This is called the conservation of angular momentum.</s>
 <s id="16">Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers, one that gives the spin rate and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis.</s>
 <s id="17">If something is freely spinning, as one number gets bigger, the other gets smaller.</s>
 <s id="18">Arms closer, spin faster.</s>
 <s id="19">Arms farther, spin slower.</s>
 <s id="20">Spin causes other effects, too.</s>
 <s id="21">If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round and you toss a ball to a friend, it will appear to follow a curving path.</s>
 <s id="22">It doesn't actually curve, though.</s>
 <s id="23">It really goes in a straight line.</s>
 <s id="24">You were the one who was following a curving path, but, from your point of view, the ball appears to curve.</s>
 <s id="25">We call this the coriolis effect.</s>
 <s id="26">Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round right now at this very moment.</s>
 <s id="27">We call it the Earth.</s>
 <s id="28">The Earth spins on its axis once each day.</s>
 <s id="29">But why does the Earth spin?</s>
 <s id="30">Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago.</s>
 <s id="31">A cloud of dust and gas that form the Sun and the Earth and the planets and you and me started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together.</s>
 <s id="32">Before it started to collapse, this cloud had a very gentle spin.</s>
 <s id="33">And, as it collapsed, like that ice skater pulling her arms in, the spin got faster and faster.</s>
 <s id="34">And everything that formed out of the cloud, the Sun and the planets around the Sun and the moons around the planets, all inherited this spin.</s>
 <s id="35">And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day.</s>
 <s id="36">And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather.</s>
 <s id="37">The Earth is warm on the daytime side, cool on the nighttime side, and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles.</s>
 <s id="38">The differences in temperature make differences in air pressure, and the differences in air pressure make air move.</s>
 <s id="39">They make the wind blow.</s>
 <s id="40">But, because the Earth spins, the moving air curves to the right in the Northern Hemisphere because of the coriolis effect.</s>
 <s id="41">If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere, air is pushed toward it, like water going down a drain.</s>
 <s id="42">But the air curves to the right as it goes, and this gives it a spin.</s>
 <s id="43">With the dramatic low pressure in a storm, the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter, so it gets going faster and faster, and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane.</s>
 <s id="44">So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report, think about this: The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth, and the Earth's spin is a remnant, a fossil relic, of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas that collapsed to make the Earth some five billion years ago.</s>
 <s id="45">You are watching something, the spin, that is older than dirt, that's older than rocks, that's older than the Earth itself.</s>
