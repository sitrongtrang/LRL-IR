 <s id="1">Today I stand before you as a man who lives life to the full in the here and now.</s>
 <s id="2">But for a long time, I lived for death.</s>
 <s id="3">I was a young man who believed that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence.</s>
 <s id="4">I tried to right wrongs through power and aggression.</s>
 <s id="5">I had deep concerns for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them.</s>
 <s id="6">I thought violent jihad was noble, chivalrous and the best way to help.</s>
 <s id="7">At a time when so many of our people -- young people especially -- are at risk of radicalization through groups like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others, when these groups are claiming that their horrific brutality and violence are true jihad, I want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong -- completely wrong -- as was mine, then.</s>
 <s id="8">Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.</s>
 <s id="9">It includes exertion and spirituality, self-purification and devotion.</s>
 <s id="10">It refers to positive transformation through learning, wisdom and remembrance of God.</s>
 <s id="11">The word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole.</s>
 <s id="12">Jihad may at times take the form of fighting, but only sometimes, under strict conditions, within rules and limits.</s>
 <s id="13">In Islam, the benefit of an act must outweigh the harm or hardship it entails.</s>
 <s id="14">More importantly, the verses in the Koran that are connected to jihad or fighting do not cancel out the verses that talk about forgiveness, benevolence or patience.</s>
 <s id="15">But now I believe that there are no circumstances on earth where violent jihad is permissible, because it will lead to greater harm.</s>
 <s id="16">But now the idea of jihad has been hijacked.</s>
 <s id="17">It has been perverted to mean violent struggle wherever Muslims are undergoing difficulties, and turned into terrorism by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.</s>
 <s id="18">But I have come to understand that true jihad means striving to the utmost to strengthen and live those qualities which God loves: honesty, trustworthiness, compassion, benevolence, reliability, respect, truthfulness -- human values that so many of us share.</s>
 <s id="19">I was born in Bangladesh, but grew up mostly in England.</s>
 <s id="20">And I went to school here.</s>
 <s id="21">My father was an academic, and we were in the UK through his work.</s>
 <s id="22">In 1971 we were in Bangladesh when everything changed.</s>
 <s id="23">The War of Independence impacted upon us terribly, pitting family against family, neighbor against neighbor.</s>
 <s id="24">And at the age of 12 I experienced war, destitution in my family, the deaths of 22 of my relatives in horrible ways, as well as the murder of my elder brother.</s>
 <s id="25">I witnessed killing ...</s>
 <s id="26">animals feeding on corpses in the streets, starvation all around me, wanton, horrific violence -- senseless violence.</s>
 <s id="27">I was a young man, teenager, fascinated by ideas.</s>
 <s id="28">I wanted to learn, but I could not go to school for four years.</s>
 <s id="29">After the War of Independence, my father was put in prison for two and a half years, and I used to visit him every week in prison, and homeschooled myself.</s>
 <s id="30">My father was released in 1973 and he fled to England as a refugee, and we soon followed him.</s>
 <s id="31">I was 17.</s>
 <s id="32">So these experiences gave me a sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world.</s>
 <s id="33">And I had a strong desire -- a very keen, deep desire -- to right wrongs and help the victims of oppression.</s>
 <s id="34">While studying at college in the UK, I met others who showed me how I could channel that desire and help through my religion.</s>
 <s id="35">And I was radicalized -- enough to consider violence correct, even a virtue under certain circumstances.</s>
 <s id="36">So I became involved in the jihad in Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="37">I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan population against the Soviet army.</s>
 <s id="38">And I thought that was jihad: my sacred duty, which would be rewarded by God.</s>
 <s id="39">I became a preacher.</s>
 <s id="40">I was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the UK.</s>
 <s id="41">I recruited, I raised funds, I trained.</s>
 <s id="42">I confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist Islamists -- these people who use the idea of jihad to justify their lust for power, authority and control on earth: a perversion perpetuated today by fascist Islamist groups like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.</s>
 <s id="43">For a period of around 15 years, I fought for short periods of time in Kashmir and Burma, besides Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="44">Our aim was to remove the invaders, to bring relief to the oppressed victims and of course to establish an Islamic state, a caliphate for God's rule.</s>
 <s id="45">And I did this openly.</s>
 <s id="46">I didn't break any laws.</s>
 <s id="47">I was proud and grateful to be British -- I still am.</s>
 <s id="48">And I bore no hostility against this, my country, nor enmity towards the non-Muslim citizens, and I still don't.</s>
 <s id="49">During one battle in Afghanistan, some British men and I formed a special bond with a 15-year-old Afghani boy, Abdullah, an innocent, loving and lovable kid who was always eager to please.</s>
 <s id="50">He was poor.</s>
 <s id="51">And boys like him did menial tasks in the camp.</s>
 <s id="52">And he seemed happy enough, but I couldn't help wonder -- his parents must have missed him dearly.</s>
 <s id="53">And they must have dreamt about a better future for him.</s>
 <s id="54">A victim of circumstance caught up in a war, cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time.</s>
 <s id="55">One day I picked up this unexploded mortar shell in a trench, and I had it deposited in a makeshift mud hut lab.</s>
 <s id="56">And I went out on a short, pointless skirmish -- always pointless, And I came back a few hours later to discover he was dead.</s>
 <s id="57">He had tried to recover explosives from that shell.</s>
 <s id="58">It exploded, and he died a violent death, blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me.</s>
 <s id="59">So I started to question.</s>
 <s id="60">How did his death serve any purpose?</s>
 <s id="61">Why did he die and I lived?</s>
 <s id="62">I carried on.</s>
 <s id="63">I fought in Kashmir.</s>
 <s id="64">I also recruited for the Philippines, Bosnia and Chechnya.</s>
 <s id="65">And the questions grew.</s>
 <s id="66">Later in Burma, I came across Rohingya fighters, who were barely teenagers, born and brought up in the jungle, carrying machine guns and grenade launchers.</s>
 <s id="67">I met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices.</s>
 <s id="68">Looking at me, they begged me to take them away to England.</s>
 <s id="69">They simply wanted to go to school -- that was their dream.</s>
 <s id="70">My family -- my children of the same age -- were living at home in the UK, going to school, living a safe life.</s>
 <s id="71">And I couldn't help wonder how much these young boys must have spoken to one another about their dreams for such a life.</s>
 <s id="72">Victims of circumstances: these two young boys, sleeping rough on the ground, looking up at the stars, cynically exploited by their leaders for their personal lust for glory and power.</s>
 <s id="73">I soon witnessed boys like them killing one another in conflicts between rival groups.</s>
 <s id="74">And it was the same everywhere ...</s>
 <s id="75">Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma, Philippines, Chechnya; petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another in the name of jihad.</s>
 <s id="76">Muslims against Muslims.</s>
 <s id="77">Not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers; not bringing relief to the oppressed.</s>
 <s id="78">Children being used, cynically exploited; people dying in conflicts which I was supporting in the name of jihad.</s>
 <s id="79">And it still carries on today.</s>
 <s id="80">Realizing that the violent jihad I had engaged in abroad was so different -- such a chasm between what I had experienced and what I thought was sacred duty -- I had to reflect on my activities here in the UK.</s>
 <s id="81">I had to consider my preaching, recruiting, fund-raising, training, but most importantly, radicalizing -- sending young people to fight and die as I was doing -- all totally wrong.</s>
 <s id="82">So I got involved in violent jihad in the mid '80s, starting with Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="83">And by the time I finished it was in the year 2000.</s>
 <s id="84">I was completely immersed in it.</s>
 <s id="85">All around me people supported, applauded, even celebrated what we were doing in their name.</s>
 <s id="86">But by the time I learned to get out, completely disillusioned in the year 2000, 15 years had passed.</s>
 <s id="87">So what goes wrong?</s>
 <s id="88">We were so busy talking about virtue, and we were blinded by a cause.</s>
 <s id="89">And we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character.</s>
 <s id="90">We told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed, but these were unwinnable wars.</s>
 <s id="91">We became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred, complicit in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.</s>
 <s id="92">So over time, a very long time, I opened my eyes.</s>
 <s id="93">I began to dare to face the truth, to think, to face the hard questions.</s>
 <s id="94">I got in touch with my soul.</s>
 <s id="95">What have I learned?</s>
 <s id="96">That people who engage in violent jihadism, that people who are drawn to these types of extremisms, are not that different to everyone else.</s>
 <s id="97">But I believe such people can change.</s>
 <s id="98">They can regain their hearts and restore them by filling them with human values that heal.</s>
 <s id="99">When we ignore the realities, we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection.</s>
 <s id="100">And we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives.</s>
 <s id="101">I engaged in actions I thought were correct.</s>
 <s id="102">But now I began to question how I knew what I knew.</s>
 <s id="103">I endlessly told others to accept the truth, but I failed to give doubt its rightful place.</s>
 <s id="104">This conviction that people can change is rooted in my experience, my own journey.</s>
 <s id="105">Through wide reading, reflecting, contemplation, self-knowledge, I discovered, I realized that Islamists' world of us and them is false and unjust.</s>
 <s id="106">Through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted, to the inviolable truths, incontestable truths, I developed a more nuanced understanding.</s>
 <s id="107">I realized that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction, foolish preachers, only foolish preachers like I used to be, see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use to assert authenticity.</s>
 <s id="108">So I understood the vital importance of self-knowledge, political awareness and the necessity for a deep and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions, how they affect others.</s>
 <s id="109">So my plea today to everyone, especially those who sincerely believe in Islamist jihadism ...</s>
 <s id="110">refuse dogmatic authority; let go of anger, hatred and violence; learn to right wrongs without even attempting to justify cruel, unjust and futile behavior.</s>
 <s id="111">Instead create a few beautiful and useful things that outlive us.</s>
 <s id="112">Approach the world, life, with love.</s>
 <s id="113">Learn to develop or cultivate your hearts to see goodness, beauty and truth in others and in the world.</s>
 <s id="114">That way we do matter more to ourselves ...</s>
 <s id="115">to each other, to our communities and, for me, to God.</s>
 <s id="116">This is jihad -- my true jihad.</s>
 <s id="117">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="118">(Applause)</s>
