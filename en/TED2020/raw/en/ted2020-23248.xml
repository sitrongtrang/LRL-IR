 <s id="1">You’re overseeing the delivery of crucial supplies to a rebel base deep in the heart of enemy territory.</s>
 <s id="2">To get past Imperial customs, all packages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with an even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top.</s>
 <s id="3">The boxes are already being loaded onto the transport when you receive an urgent message.</s>
 <s id="4">One of the four boxes was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one.</s>
 <s id="5">All the boxes are still on the conveyor belt.</s>
 <s id="6">Two are facing down: one marked with a four, and one with a seven.</s>
 <s id="7">The other two are facing up: one with a black top, another with a red one.</s>
 <s id="8">You know that any violation of the protocol will get the entire shipment confiscated and put your allies in grave danger.</s>
 <s id="9">But any boxes you pull off for inspection won’t make it onto this delivery run, depriving the rebels of critically needed supplies.</s>
 <s id="10">The transport leaves in a few moments, with or without its cargo.</s>
 <s id="11">Which box or boxes should you grab off the conveyor belt?</s>
 <s id="12">Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself!</s>
 <s id="13">Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect all four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each.</s>
 <s id="14">But in fact, only two of them matter.</s>
 <s id="15">Let’s look at the protocol again.</s>
 <s id="16">All it says is that even-numbered boxes must have a red top.</s>
 <s id="17">It doesn’t say anything about odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore the box marked with a seven.</s>
 <s id="18">What about the box with a red top?</s>
 <s id="19">Don’t we need to check that the number on the bottom is even?</s>
 <s id="20">As it turns out, we don’t.</s>
 <s id="21">The protocol says that if a box has an even number, then it should have a red top.</s>
 <s id="22">It doesn’t say that only boxes with even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top must have an even number.</s>
 <s id="23">The requirement only goes in one direction.</s>
 <s id="24">So we don’t need to check the box with the red lid.</s>
 <s id="25">We do, however, need to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly placed on an even-numbered box.</s>
 <s id="26">If you initially assumed the rules imply a symmetrical match between the number on the box and the type of lid, you’re not alone.</s>
 <s id="27">That error is so common, we even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse.</s>
 <s id="28">This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition is necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it.</s>
 <s id="29">For instance, having an atmosphere is a necessary condition for being a habitable planet.</s>
 <s id="30">But this doesn’t mean that it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres but lack other criteria for habitability.</s>
 <s id="31">If that still seems hard to wrap your head around, let’s look at a slightly different problem.</s>
 <s id="32">Imagine the boxes contain groceries.</s>
 <s id="33">You see one marked for shipment to a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant.</s>
 <s id="34">Then you see two more boxes turned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions.</s>
 <s id="35">Which ones do you need to check?</s>
 <s id="36">Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped to the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there doesn’t contain meat.</s>
 <s id="37">The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse can contain either product.</s>
 <s id="38">Why does this scenario seem easier?</s>
 <s id="39">Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions for the top of the box, and two for the bottom.</s>
 <s id="40">But in this case, they’re based on familiar real-world needs, and we easily understand that while vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so.</s>
 <s id="41">In the original problem, the rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections become harder to see.</s>
 <s id="42">In your case, you’ve managed to get enough supplies through to enable the resistance to fight another day.</s>
 <s id="43">And you did it by thinking outside the box – both sides of it.</s>
