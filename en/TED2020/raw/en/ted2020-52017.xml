 <s id="1">While regaling you with daring stories from her youth, it might be hard to believe your grandmother used to be a trapeze artist.</s>
 <s id="2">However, the bad backs, elbow pain, and creaky knees so common in older people is more than just “old age."</s>
 <s id="3">In fact, the source of this stiffness plagues many young people as well.</s>
 <s id="4">The culprit is arthritis: a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the joints of over 90 million people in the U.S. alone.</s>
 <s id="5">But are stiff, creaky joints really inevitable?</s>
 <s id="6">What makes arthritis so pervasive, and why haven’t we found a cure for this widespread condition?</s>
 <s id="7">The first hurdle is that arthritis is actually a spectrum of over 100 different arthritic conditions.</s>
 <s id="8">All these conditions share symptoms of joint pain and inflammation, but the origin and severity of those symptoms vary widely.</s>
 <s id="9">Even the most common type, osteoarthritis, is trickier to prevent than one might think.</s>
 <s id="10">It’s a general misconception that arthritis is confined to old age.</s>
 <s id="11">The origins of osteoarthritis can often be traced to a patient’s early life, from any seemingly ordinary joint injury.</s>
 <s id="12">Following impact, immune cells rush in to help clean and repair the damaged site and begin pumping out enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanases.</s>
 <s id="13">These enzymes clear out the damaged tissue and contribute to inflammation.</s>
 <s id="14">But while this rapid swelling helps protect the joint during recovery, inadequately healed tissue can cause these immune cells to overstay their welcome.</s>
 <s id="15">The continuing flood of enzymes starts to degrade the cartilage, weakening the joint and leading to arthritis later on.</s>
 <s id="16">Not all forms of arthritis can simply be traced to an old sports injury.</s>
 <s id="17">Take rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 1.3 million U.S. adults.</s>
 <s id="18">This condition is actually an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies target natively produced proteins, some of which are secreted by cartilage cells.</s>
 <s id="19">We still don’t know what causes this behavior, but the result is that the body treats joint tissue like a foreign invader.</s>
 <s id="20">Immune cells infiltrate the joint despite there being no tissue damage to repair.</s>
 <s id="21">This response leads to chronic inflammation, which destroys bone and cartilage.</s>
 <s id="22">Yet another condition, spondyloarthritis, has similarities to both of the conditions we’ve covered.</s>
 <s id="23">Patients experience continuous inflammation in the joints and at the sites where ligaments and tendons attach to bones, even without any initial injury.</s>
 <s id="24">This leads to the flood of enzymes and degradation seen in osteoarthritis, but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cytokines.</s>
 <s id="25">As the enzymes eat away at cartilage, the body attempts to stabilize smaller joints by fusing them together.</s>
 <s id="26">This process sometimes leads to outgrowths called bone spurs, which also cause intense stiffness and joint pain.</s>
 <s id="27">With so many factors causing arthritis, our current treatments are tailored to tackle specific symptoms rather than underlying causes.</s>
 <s id="28">These range from promising MACI techniques, which harvest cells from small pieces of cartilage to grow replacement tissue.</s>
 <s id="29">To a technique called microfracture, where surgeons create small holes in the bone, allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new cartilage.</s>
 <s id="30">As a last resort, people with withered cartilage can even undergo full joint replacements.</s>
 <s id="31">But outside these drastic measures, the underlying drivers of autoimmune arthritis still present a unique treatment challenge.</s>
 <s id="32">Scientists are making progress with therapies that block TNF-alpha, one of the primary proteins causing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.</s>
 <s id="33">But even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition, not the cause.</s>
 <s id="34">In the meantime, some of our best defenses against arthritis are lifestyle choices: maintaining a healthy weight to take pressure off joints, low-impact exercises like yoga or cycling, and avoiding smoking.</s>
 <s id="35">These arthritis-fighting behaviors can help us lead longer lives as we continue to research cures and treatments for the huge diversity of arthritic conditions.</s>
