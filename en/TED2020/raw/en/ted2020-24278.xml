 <s id="1">Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life.</s>
 <s id="2">If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you?</s>
 <s id="3">That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the Experience Machine.</s>
 <s id="4">The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain.</s>
 <s id="5">The catch?</s>
 <s id="6">You have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference.</s>
 <s id="7">Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality.</s>
 <s id="8">Life's natural ups and downs will just be replaced with an endless series of ups.</s>
 <s id="9">Sounds great, right?</s>
 <s id="10">It may seem like a tempting offer, but perhaps it's not as ideal as it sounds.</s>
 <s id="11">The experiment was actually designed to refute a philosophical notion called hedonism.</s>
 <s id="12">According to hedonists, maximizing net pleasure is the most important thing in life because pleasure is the greatest good that life has to offer.</s>
 <s id="13">For hedonists, the best choice that a person could make for himself is one that brings him the greatest possible amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain.</s>
 <s id="14">Limitless pleasure minus zero pain equals maximum net pleasure, or in other words, the exact scenario the Experience Machine offers.</s>
 <s id="15">Therefore, if hedonism is your philosophy of choice, plugging in would be a no-brainer.</s>
 <s id="16">But what if there's more to life than just pleasure?</s>
 <s id="17">That's what Nozick believed he was demonstrating through his Experience Machine thought experiment.</s>
 <s id="18">Despite the machine's promise of maximum net pleasure, he still found reason not to plug in, as do many other experimenters who consider the proposition.</s>
 <s id="19">But what could possibly dissuade us from choosing a future of ultimate pleasure?</s>
 <s id="20">Consider this scenario.</s>
 <s id="21">Betsy and Xander are in a loving, committed relationship.</s>
 <s id="22">Betsy is head over heels and has never felt happier.</s>
 <s id="23">However, unbeknownst to Betsy, Xander has been romancing her sister, Angelica, with love letters and secret rendezvous for the duration of their relationship.</s>
 <s id="24">If Betsy found out, it would destroy her relationships with both Xander and Angelica, and the experience would be so traumatic, she would never love again.</s>
 <s id="25">Since Betsy is in blissful ignorance about Xander's infidelity, hedonists would say she's better off remaining in the dark and maintaining her high level of net pleasure.</s>
 <s id="26">As long as Betsy never finds out about the relationship, her life is guaranteed to go on as happily as it is right now.</s>
 <s id="27">So, is there value in Besty knowing the truth of her situation?</s>
 <s id="28">Imagine if you were Betsy.</s>
 <s id="29">Would you prefer to know the truth?</s>
 <s id="30">If the answer is yes, you'd be choosing an option that sharply decreases your net pleasure.</s>
 <s id="31">Perhaps, then, you believe that there are things in life with greater intrinsic value than pleasure.</s>
 <s id="32">Truth, knowledge, authentic connection with other human beings.</s>
 <s id="33">These are all things that might make the list.</s>
 <s id="34">By never learning the truth, Betsy is essentially living life in her own personal Experience Machine, a world of happiness that's not based in reality.</s>
 <s id="35">This love triangle is an extreme example, but it mirrors many of the decisions we make in day to day life.</s>
 <s id="36">So whether you're making a choice for Betsy or for yourself, why might you feel reality should be a factor?</s>
 <s id="37">Is there inherent value in real experiences, whether pleasurable or painful?</s>
 <s id="38">Do you yourself have more value when you're experiencing real life's pleasures and pains?</s>
 <s id="39">Nozick's experiment may not provide all the answers, but it forces us to consider whether real life, though imperfect, holds some intrinsic value beyond the pleasure of plugging in.</s>
