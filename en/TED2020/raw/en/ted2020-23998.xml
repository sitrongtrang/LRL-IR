 <s id="1">Oh, excuse me!</s>
 <s id="2">Have you ever yawned because somebody else yawned?</s>
 <s id="3">You aren't especially tired, yet suddenly your mouth opens wide and a big yawn comes out.</s>
 <s id="4">This phenomenon is known as contagious yawning.</s>
 <s id="5">And while scientists still don't fully understand why it happens, there are many hypotheses currently being researched.</s>
 <s id="6">Let's take a look at a few of the most prevalent ones, beginning with two physiological hypotheses before moving to a psychological one.</s>
 <s id="7">Our first physiological hypothesis states that contagious yawning is triggered by a specific stimulus, an initial yawn.</s>
 <s id="8">This is called fixed action pattern.</s>
 <s id="9">Think of fixed action pattern like a reflex.</s>
 <s id="10">Your yawn makes me yawn.</s>
 <s id="11">Similar to a domino effect, one person's yawn triggers a yawn in a person nearby that has observed the act.</s>
 <s id="12">Once this reflex is triggered, it must run its course.</s>
 <s id="13">Have you ever tried to stop a yawn once it has begun?</s>
 <s id="14">Basically impossible!</s>
 <s id="15">Another physiological hypothesis is known as non-conscious mimicry, or the chameleon effect.</s>
 <s id="16">This occurs when you imitate someone's behavior without knowing it, a subtle and unintentional copycat maneuver.</s>
 <s id="17">People tend to mimic each other's postures.</s>
 <s id="18">If you are seated across from someone that has their legs crossed, you might cross your own legs.</s>
 <s id="19">This hypothesis suggests that we yawn when we see someone else yawn because we are unconsciously copying his or her behavior.</s>
 <s id="20">Scientists believe that this chameleon effect is possible because of a special set of neurons known as mirror neurons.</s>
 <s id="21">Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that responds equally when we perform an action as when we see someone else perform the same action.</s>
 <s id="22">These neurons are important for learning and self-awareness.</s>
 <s id="23">For example, watching someone do something physical, like knitting or putting on lipstick, can help you do those same actions more accurately.</s>
 <s id="24">Neuroimaging studies using fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging, show us that when we seem someone yawn or even hear their yawn, a specific area of the brain housing these mirror neurons tends to light up, which, in turn, causes us to respond with the same action: a yawn!</s>
 <s id="25">Our psychological hypothesis also involves the work of these mirror neurons.</s>
 <s id="26">We will call it the empathy yawn.</s>
 <s id="27">Empathy is the ability to understand what someone else is feeling and partake in their emotion, a crucial ability for social animals like us.</s>
 <s id="28">Recently, neuroscientists have found that a subset of mirror neurons allows us to empathize with others' feelings at a deeper level.</s>
 <s id="29">(Yawn) Scientists discovered this empathetic response to yawning while testing the first hypothesis we mentioned, fixed action pattern.</s>
 <s id="30">This study was set up to show that dogs would enact a yawn reflex at the mere sound of a human yawn.</s>
 <s id="31">While their study showed this to be true, they found something else interesting.</s>
 <s id="32">Dogs yawned more frequently at familiar yawns, such as from their owners, than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers.</s>
 <s id="33">Following this research, other studies on humans and primates have also shown that contagious yawning occurs more frequently among friends than strangers.</s>
 <s id="34">In fact, contagious yawning starts occurring when we are about four or five years old, at the point when children develop the ability to identify others' emotions properly.</s>
 <s id="35">Still, while newer scientific studies aim to prove that contagious yawning is based on this capacity for empathy, more research is needed to shed light on what exactly is going on.</s>
 <s id="36">It's possible that the answer lies in another hypothesis altogether.</s>
 <s id="37">The next time you get caught in a yawn, take a second to think about what just happened.</s>
 <s id="38">Were you thinking about a yawn?</s>
 <s id="39">Did someone near you yawn?</s>
 <s id="40">Was that person a stranger or someone close?</s>
 <s id="41">And are you yawning right now?</s>
