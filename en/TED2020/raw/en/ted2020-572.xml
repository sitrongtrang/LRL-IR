 <s id="1">Why do so many people reach success and then fail?</s>
 <s id="2">One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">So we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there.</s>
  <s id="3.2">We figure we've made it, we sit back in our comfort zone, and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">And it doesn't take long to go downhill.</s>
 <s id="5">And I can tell you this happens, because it happened to me.</s>
 <s id="6">Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.</s>
 <s id="7">But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.</s>
 <s id="8">I can just sit back and relax."</s>
 <s id="9">Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.</s>
 <s id="10">But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.</s>
 <s id="11">I don't need to improve any more."</s>
 <s id="12">Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.</s>
 <s id="13">Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.</s>
 <s id="14">But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.</s>
 <s id="15">And the only thing that came was creative block.</s>
 <s id="16">I couldn't come up with any ideas.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money.</s>
  <s id="17.2">Then all this money started pouring in.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">And I got distracted by it.</s>
 <s id="19">And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent, when I should have been talking to my clients.</s>
 <s id="20">And reaching success, I always did what I loved.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management.</s>
  <s id="21.2">I am the world's worst manager, but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all, the president of the company.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed.</s>
 <s id="23">But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.</s>
 <s id="24">I bought a fast car.</s>
 <s id="25">(Laughter) It didn't help.</s>
 <s id="26">I was faster but just as depressed.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">So I went to my doctor.</s>
  <s id="27.2">I said, "Doc, I can buy anything I want.</s>
  <s id="27.3">But I'm not happy.</s>
  <s id="27.4">I'm depressed.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.</s>
 <s id="29">But money can't buy happiness."</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">He said, "No.</s>
  <s id="30.2">But it can buy Prozac."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">And he put me on anti-depressants.</s>
 <p id="p32">
  <s id="32.1">And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work, because I was just floating along.</s>
  <s id="32.2">I couldn't care less if clients ever called.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) And clients didn't call.</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself.</s>
 <s id="35">So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.</s>
 <s id="36">Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.</s>
 <s id="37">My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.</s>
 <s id="38">It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.</s>
 <s id="39">And that was great.</s>
 <s id="40">Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.</s>
 <s id="41">So I went back to doing the projects I loved.</s>
 <s id="42">I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short, did all the things that took me back up to success.</s>
 <s id="43">But it wasn't a quick trip.</s>
 <s id="44">It took seven years.</s>
 <s id="45">But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.</s>
 <s id="46">And when I went back to following these eight principles, the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.</s>
 <s id="47">And I woke up one day and I said, "I don't need Prozac anymore."</s>
 <s id="48">And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.</s>
 <s id="49">I learned that success isn't a one-way street.</s>
 <s id="50">It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.</s>
 <s id="51">It's a continuous journey.</s>
 <s id="52">And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome," we just keep following these eight principles, because that is not only how we achieve success, it's how we sustain it.</s>
 <s id="53">So here is to your continued success.</s>
 <s id="54">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="55">(Applause)</s>
