 <s id="1">When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.</s>
 <s id="2">My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio.</s>
 <s id="3">There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him.</s>
 <s id="4">"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.</s>
 <s id="5">I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.</s>
 <s id="6">"You can go to a real school now," he said.</s>
 <s id="7">A morning that I will never forget.</s>
 <s id="8">A real school.</s>
 <s id="9">You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.</s>
 <s id="10">So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school.</s>
 <s id="11">It was the only way we both could be educated.</s>
 <s id="12">Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.</s>
 <s id="13">We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.</s>
 <s id="14">The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.</s>
 <s id="15">It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.</s>
 <s id="16">We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.</s>
 <s id="17">From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious.</s>
 <s id="18">We always wondered what they knew about us.</s>
 <s id="19">Were we being followed?</s>
 <s id="20">Do they know where we live?</s>
 <s id="21">We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be.</s>
 <s id="22">I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured.</s>
 <s id="23">My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.</s>
 <s id="24">A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.</s>
 <s id="25">But my educated mother became a teacher.</s>
 <s id="26">There she is.</s>
 <s id="27">She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.</s>
 <s id="28">And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.</s>
 <s id="29">There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.</s>
 <s id="30">To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.</s>
 <s id="31">During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.</s>
 <s id="32">I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">Your money can be stolen.</s>
  <s id="33.2">You can be forced to leave your home during a war.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will.</s>
 <s id="35">So do you still not want to continue?"</s>
 <s id="36">Today I am 22.</s>
 <s id="37">I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.</s>
 <s id="38">Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.</s>
 <s id="39">Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.</s>
 <s id="40">(Applause) When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me.</s>
 <s id="41">He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul.</s>
 <s id="42">(Applause) My family believes in me.</s>
 <s id="43">I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.</s>
 <s id="44">That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women.</s>
 <s id="45">That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.</s>
 <s id="46">The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity.</s>
 <s id="47">And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">Like Ahmed.</s>
  <s id="48.2">That's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes.</s>
 <s id="50">As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.</s>
 <s id="51">"Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas."</s>
 <s id="52">What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success.</s>
 <s id="53">It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.</s>
 <s id="54">In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.</s>
 <s id="55">Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.</s>
 <s id="56">But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.</s>
 <s id="57">(Applause) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.</s>
 <s id="58">I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.</s>
 <s id="59">I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.</s>
 <s id="60">But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change.</s>
 <s id="61">To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that.</s>
 <s id="62">Like me, they are dreaming big.</s>
 <s id="63">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="64">(Applause)</s>
