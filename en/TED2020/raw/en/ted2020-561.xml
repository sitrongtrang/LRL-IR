 <s id="2">I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2; that is the weight of two elephants.</s>
 <s id="3">I came here to speak about ecology, and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year.</s>
 <s id="4">So what do I have to do?</s>
 <s id="5">I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) I have to do my carbon offset in another way, like I do every time.</s>

 <s id="10">You know the problem; we don't want to believe what we know.</s>
 <s id="11">In Alberta people work nonstop, 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can.</s>
 <s id="12">We know about the end of oil.</s>
 <s id="13">Oil sand is not a long-term solution.</s>
 <s id="14">But we use three times more oil than we find every year.</s>
 <s id="15">We don't want to believe what we know.</s>

 <s id="48">Landscape was not enough.</s>
 <s id="49">It was obvious to me to do another work.</s>
 <s id="50">I launched a project named Six Billion Others.</s>
 <s id="51">I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question, the same crucial question, about life.</s>
 <s id="52">We have done five thousand interviews.</s>
 <s id="53">I'm going to show you this.</s>
 <s id="54">Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?</s>
 <s id="55">It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">Woman: Love?</s>
  <s id="56.2">Love is nice if you can have it.</s>

 <s id="62">Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.</s>
 <s id="63">10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.</s>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">11th Man: Who am I?</s>
  <s id="64.2">Isn't that the biggest question?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people, I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.</s>
 <s id="66">Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons.</s>
 <s id="67">I feel ashamed.</s>

 </p>
 <s id="73">At the moment, my family is very poor, my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.</s>
 <s id="74">I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.</s>
 <s id="75">If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.</s>
 <s id="76">Thank you.</s>
 <p id="p77">

  <s id="79.1">I still surf.</s>
  <s id="79.2">I sail the world.</s>
  <s id="79.3">I freedive.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">After many people said I couldn't do that.</s>
 <s id="81">And I think that comes from connecting with nature, connecting with the energy of life, because we're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually, mentally or physically.</s>
 <s id="82">I got the easy part.</s>
 <s id="83">14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.</s>
 <s id="84">You come from elsewhere.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">You don't know me.</s>

 <s id="90">Forty crucial questions.</s>
 <s id="91">Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.</s>
 <s id="92">For the last three years, I was shooting the earth for the movie.</s>
 <s id="93">The name of the movie is "Home" -- "Maison."</s>
 <s id="94">It is about the state of the planet.</s>
 <s id="95">It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.</s>
 <s id="96">I'm very proud to show you the teaser.</s>
 <s id="97">Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.</s>
 <s id="98">These plants, several hundred million years old.</s>
 <s id="99">And we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years.</s>
 <s id="100">We've managed to adapt, and have conquered the whole planet.</s>
 <s id="101">For generations, we've been raising our children, not unlike millions of other species living beside us.</s>
 <s id="102">For the past 30 years I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky.</s>
 <s id="103">Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.</s>
 <s id="104">We depend on water, forests, deserts, oceans.</s>
 <s id="105">Fishing, breeding, farming are still the world's foremost human occupations.</s>
 <s id="106">And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us.</s>
 <s id="107">We all share the same need for the earth's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves, and become better.</s>
 <s id="108">And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart.</s>
 <s id="109">Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.</s>
 <s id="110">In less than 50 years we've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind.</s>
 <s id="111">Half of the world's forests have vanished.</s>
 <s id="112">Water resources are running low.</s>
 <s id="113">Intensive farming is depleting soils.</s>
 <s id="114">Our energy sources are not sustainable.</s>
 <s id="115">The climate is changing.</s>
 <s id="116">We are endangering ourselves.</s>
 <s id="117">We're only trying to improve our lives.</s>
 <s id="118">But the wealth gaps are growing wider.</s>
 <s id="119">We haven't yet understood that we're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain.</s>
 <s id="120">We know that solutions are available today.</s>
 <s id="121">We all have the power to change this trend for the better.</s>
 <s id="122">So what are we waiting for?</s>
 <s id="123">(Applause) YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.</s>
 <s id="124">But it is not a normal movie.</s>
 <s id="125">The film is going to be distributed free.</s>
 <s id="126">This film has no copyright.</s>
 <s id="127">On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.</s>
 <s id="128">The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June.</s>
 <s id="129">There is no business on this movie.</s>
 <s id="130">It is also available for school, cities, NGOs and you.</s>
 <s id="131">We have to believe what we know.</s>
 <s id="132">Let me tell you something.</s>
 <s id="133">It's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late.</s>
 <s id="134">We have all a part of the solutions.</s>
 <s id="135">To finish, I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk.</s>
 <p id="p136">
  <s id="136.1">Merci beaucoup.</s>
  <s id="136.2">I love you.</s>
