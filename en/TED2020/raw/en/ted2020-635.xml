 <s id="1">So the question is, what is invisible?</s>
 <s id="2">There is more of it than you think, actually.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">Everything, I would say.</s>
  <s id="3.2">Everything that matters except every thing and except matter.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">We can see matter.</s>
  <s id="4.2">But we can't see what's the matter.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently: "The marriage suffered a setback in 1965, when the husband was killed by the wife."</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) So, we can see the stars and the planets, but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together.</s>
 <s id="8">With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.</s>
 <s id="9">We can't see into the engine room.</s>
 <s id="10">We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.</s>
 <s id="11">And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.</s>
 <s id="12">In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, if you look at the basic substructure of matter, there isn't anything there.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy.</s>
  <s id="13.2">And you can't see energy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.</s>
 <s id="15">One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you.</s>
 <s id="16">And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.</s>
 <s id="17">It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.</s>
 <s id="18">The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.</s>
 <s id="19">Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.</s>
 <s id="21">A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him, had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.</s>
 <s id="22">After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) "I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.</s>
 <s id="24">"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness, she turns it to her advantage.</s>
 <s id="25">A photo is not enough."</s>
 <s id="26">So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.</s>
 <s id="27">And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish, "To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."</s>
 <s id="28">After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him, "Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?</s>
 <s id="29">I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) So, one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand.</s>
 <s id="32">Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.</s>
 <s id="33">It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.</s>
 <s id="34">And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.</s>
 <s id="35">For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.</s>
 <s id="36">That's what he thought he was there for.</s>
 <s id="37">So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.</s>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">(Laughter) Consciousness.</s>
  <s id="38.2">I see all your faces.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p39">
  <s id="39.1">I have no idea what any of you are thinking.</s>
  <s id="39.2">Isn't that amazing?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="40">Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?</s>
 <s id="41">But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">But we can't read each other's minds.</s>
  <s id="42.2">I find that quite astonishing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.</s>
 <s id="44">But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.</s>
 <s id="45">So that's why we don't think it exists, the Sufi masters working on us.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere.</s>
  <s id="46.2">We have no idea how consciousness works.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.</s>
 <s id="48">(Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.</s>
 <s id="49">Remind you of anyone?</s>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">Interesting.</s>
  <s id="50.2">I'm, as you can guess, not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic.</s>
  <s id="51.2">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">I'm an ignostic.</s>
 <s id="53">I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists, until somebody properly defines the terms.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) Another thing we can't see is the human genome.</s>
 <s id="55">And this is increasingly peculiar, because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome, they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.</s>
 <s id="56">Geneticists will know this, but every year since, it's been revised downwards.</s>
 <s id="57">We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">This is extraordinary.</s>
  <s id="58.2">Because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes.</s>
  <s id="59.2">Do you know that?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">Two more than people, and the same as a gorilla.</s>
 <s id="61">(Laughter) You can't see these things, but they are very strange.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">(Laughter) The stars by day.</s>
  <s id="62.2">I always think that's fascinating.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">The universe disappears.</s>
 <s id="64">The more light there is, the less you can see.</s>
 <s id="65">Time, nobody can see time.</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">I don't know if you know this.</s>
  <s id="66.2">Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="67">It's much easier if it's not really there.</s>
 <s id="68">You can't see the future, obviously.</s>
 <s id="69">And you can't see the past, except in your memory.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see.</s>
  <s id="70.2">My son asked me this the other day, he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And I said, "Yes."</s>
  <s id="71.2">And he said, "Why can't I?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">Isn't that extraordinary?</s>
  <s id="72.2">You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three, which is great news for psychoanalysts, because otherwise they'd be out of a job.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are.</s>
 <s id="74">Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.</s>
 <p id="p75">
  <s id="75.1">This is fascinating.</s>
  <s id="75.2">You probably know, some of you, that cells are continually renewed.</s>
  <s id="75.3">You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="76">Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.</s>
 <s id="77">But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.</s>
 <s id="78">Taste buds, every 10 days or so.</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer.</s>
  <s id="79.2">A spine takes several years.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago.</s>
 <s id="81">The question is, who, then, are we?</s>
 <p id="p82">
  <s id="82.1">What are we?</s>
  <s id="82.2">What is this thing that we hang on, that is actually us?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">Okay.</s>
  <s id="83.2">Atoms, you can't see them.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p84">
  <s id="84.1">Nobody ever will.</s>
  <s id="84.2">They're smaller than the wavelength of light.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="85">Gas, you can't see that.</s>
 <p id="p86">
  <s id="86.1">Interesting.</s>
  <s id="86.2">Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="87">Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.</s>
 <s id="88">It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual.</s>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">Quite good.</s>
  <s id="89.2">He also invented a word called "blas," meaning astral radiation.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="90">Didn't catch on, unfortunately.</s>
 <s id="91">(Laughter) But well done, him.</s>
 <s id="92">(Laughter) There is so many things that -- Light.</s>
 <p id="p93">
  <s id="93.1">You can't see light.</s>
  <s id="93.2">When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes, you won't see it.</s>
  <s id="93.3">Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="94">But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits.</s>
 <s id="95">I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light, not to be able to see darkness.</s>
 <s id="96">Electricity, you can't see that.</s>
 <s id="97">Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.</s>
 <p id="p98">
  <s id="98.1">They don't.</s>
  <s id="98.2">Nobody knows what it is.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p99">
  <s id="99.1">(Laughter) You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light when you turn the light on.</s>
  <s id="99.2">They don't.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="100">Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading honey, they say.</s>
 <s id="101">(Laughter) Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.</s>
 <p id="p102">
  <s id="102.1">100 billion.</s>
  <s id="102.2">How many can we see?</s>
  <s id="102.3">Five.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="103">Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye, and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.</s>
 <p id="p104">
  <s id="104.1">Radio waves.</s>
  <s id="104.2">There's another thing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="105">Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887, he called them radio waves because they radiated.</s>
 <s id="106">And somebody said to him, "Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?</s>
 <s id="107">What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"</s>
 <s id="108">And he said, "Well, I've no idea.</s>
 <s id="109">But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."</s>
 <p id="p110">
  <s id="110.1">And that's what they do, radio.</s>
  <s id="110.2">That's what they discovered.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="111">Anyway, so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know.</s>
 <s id="112">It is incredible how little we know.</s>
 <s id="113">Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything."</s>
 <s id="114">And I've come to the conclusion -- because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"</s>
 <p id="p115">
  <s id="115.1">The point, most of us.</s>
  <s id="115.2">What's the point?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p116">
  <s id="116.1">(Laughter) (Applause) You can't see a point.</s>
  <s id="116.2">It's by definition dimensionless, like an electron, oddly enough.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="117">But the point, what I've got it down to, is there are only two questions really worth asking.</s>
 <s id="118">"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?</s>
 <s id="119">And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century, one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.</s>
 <s id="120">The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said, "I don't know why we are here.</s>
 <s id="121">But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."</s>
 <s id="122">(Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?</s>
 <s id="123">(Laughter) And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, "We are here on earth to help others.</s>
 <s id="124">What the others are here for, I've no idea."</s>
 <s id="125">(Laughter) (Applause)</s>
