 <s id="1">The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.</s>
 <s id="2">If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest, we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.</s>
 <s id="3">This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.</s>
 <s id="4">We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.</s>
 <s id="5">There are very few doctors and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics.</s>
 <s id="6">So what the Western countries, developed countries, have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can't afford these medications.</s>
 <s id="7">And this has already saved millions of lives, and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
 <s id="8">But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease, because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.</s>
 <s id="9">This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
 <s id="10">The problem is that, what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem.</s>
 <s id="11">And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world, because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.</s>
 <s id="12">I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda.</s>
 <s id="13">This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic, before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
 <s id="14">And during that time, I actually lost more relatives, as well as the teachers who taught me, to HIV/AIDS.</s>
 <s id="15">So this became one of the driving passions of my life, to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.</s>
 <s id="16">We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.</s>
 <s id="17">Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room, and people actually used to work inside the computers.</s>
 <s id="18">But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone.</s>
 <s id="19">And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world, in the Third World countries.</s>
 <s id="20">The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories.</s>
 <s id="21">So, right now, we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips.</s>
 <s id="22">I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school, and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices.</s>
 <s id="23">This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.</s>
 <s id="24">A close look at how the technology works: These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.</s>
 <s id="25">So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system.</s>
 <s id="26">So, with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone, you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time.</s>
 <s id="27">For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient.</s>
 <s id="28">And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current state of the art, at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options.</s>
 <s id="29">So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.</s>
 <s id="30">I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.</s>
 <s id="31">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="32">(Applause)</s>
