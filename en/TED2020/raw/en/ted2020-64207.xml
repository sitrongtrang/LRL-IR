 <s id="1">Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled Martian bases, and are holding a vote to determine its location.</s>
 <s id="2">Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base.</s>
 <s id="3">For our purposes, let’s assume that everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, and will vote accordingly.</s>
 <s id="4">What is the fairest way to conduct that vote?</s>
 <s id="5">The most straightforward solution would be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose the location with the most votes.</s>
 <s id="6">This is known as plurality voting, or "first past the post."</s>
 <s id="7">In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents than any other.</s>
 <s id="8">And yet, most colonists would consider this the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else.</s>
 <s id="9">So is plurality vote really the fairest method?</s>
 <s id="10">What if we tried a system like instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range of people’s preferences rather than just their top choices?</s>
 <s id="11">Here’s how it would work.</s>
 <s id="12">First, voters rank each of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks.</s>
 <s id="13">South receives the fewest votes for first place, so it’s eliminated.</s>
 <s id="14">Its 15 votes get allocated to those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32.</s>
 <s id="15">We then compare top preferences and cut the last place option again.</s>
 <s id="16">This time North Base is eliminated.</s>
 <s id="17">Its residents’ second choice would’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone, the votes go to their third choice.</s>
 <s id="18">That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, making it the winner.</s>
 <s id="19">But this doesn’t seem fair either.</s>
 <s id="20">Not only did East start out in second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among their two least preferred options.</s>
 <s id="21">Instead of using rankings, we could try voting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners proceeding to a separate runoff.</s>
 <s id="22">Normally, this would mean West and North winning the first round, and North winning the second.</s>
 <s id="23">But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have the votes to win, they can still skew the results in their favor.</s>
 <s id="24">In the first round, they vote for South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North from advancing.</s>
 <s id="25">Thanks to this "tactical voting" by East Base residents, South wins the second round easily, despite being the least populated.</s>
 <s id="26">Can a system be called fair and good if it incentivizes lying about your preferences?</s>
 <s id="27">Maybe what we need to do is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup.</s>
 <s id="28">This is known as the Condorcet method.</s>
 <s id="29">Consider one matchup: West versus North.</s>
 <s id="30">All 100 colonists vote on their preference between the two.</s>
 <s id="31">So that's West's 42 versus the 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North.</s>
 <s id="32">Now do the same for the other five matchups.</s>
 <s id="33">The victor will be whichever base wins the most times.</s>
 <s id="34">Here, North wins three and South wins two.</s>
 <s id="35">These are indeed the two most central locations, and North has the advantage of not being anyone’s least preferred choice.</s>
 <s id="36">So does that make the Condorcet method an ideal voting system in general?</s>
 <s id="37">Not necessarily.</s>
 <s id="38">Consider an election with three candidates.</s>
 <s id="39">If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, but prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner.</s>
 <s id="40">Over the decades, researchers and statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways of conducting and counting votes, and some have even been put into practice.</s>
 <s id="41">But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering an unfair result.</s>
 <s id="42">It turns out that our intuitive concept of fairness actually contains a number of assumptions that may contradict each other.</s>
 <s id="43">It doesn’t seem fair for some voters to have more influence than others.</s>
 <s id="44">But nor does it seem fair to simply ignore minority preferences, or encourage people to game the system.</s>
 <s id="45">In fact, mathematical proofs have shown that for any election with more than two options, it’s impossible to design a voting system that doesn’t violate at least some theoretically desirable criteria.</s>
 <s id="46">So while we often think of democracy as a simple matter of counting votes, it’s also worth considering who benefits from the different ways of counting them.</s>
