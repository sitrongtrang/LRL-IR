 <s id="1">Hello.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm not a real person.</s>
 <s id="3">I'm actually a copy of a real person.</s>
 <s id="4">Although, I feel like a real person.</s>
 <s id="5">It's kind of hard to explain.</s>
 <s id="6">Hold on -- I think I saw a real person ... there's one.</s>
 <s id="7">Let's bring him onstage.</s>
 <s id="8">Hello.</s>
 <s id="9">(Applause) What you see up there is a digital human.</s>
 <s id="10">I'm wearing an inertial motion capture suit that's figuring what my body is doing.</s>
 <s id="11">And I've got a single camera here that's watching my face and feeding some machine-learning software that's taking my expressions, like, "Hm, hm, hm," and transferring it to that guy.</s>
 <s id="12">We call him "DigiDoug."</s>
 <s id="13">He's actually a 3-D character that I'm controlling live in real time.</s>
 <s id="14">So, I work in visual effects.</s>
 <s id="15">And in visual effects, one of the hardest things to do is to create believable, digital humans that the audience accepts as real.</s>
 <s id="16">People are just really good at recognizing other people.</s>
 <s id="17">Go figure!</s>
 <s id="18">So, that's OK, we like a challenge.</s>
 <s id="19">Over the last 15 years, we've been putting humans and creatures into film that you accept as real.</s>
 <s id="20">If they're happy, you should feel happy.</s>
 <s id="21">And if they feel pain, you should empathize with them.</s>
 <s id="22">We're getting pretty good at it, too.</s>
 <s id="23">But it's really, really difficult.</s>
 <s id="24">Effects like these take thousands of hours and hundreds of really talented artists.</s>
 <s id="25">But things have changed.</s>
 <s id="26">Over the last five years, computers and graphics cards have gotten seriously fast.</s>
 <s id="27">And machine learning, deep learning, has happened.</s>
 <s id="28">So we asked ourselves: Do you suppose we could create a photo-realistic human, like we're doing for film, but where you're seeing the actual emotions and the details of the person who's controlling the digital human in real time?</s>
 <s id="29">In fact, that's our goal: If you were having a conversation with DigiDoug one-on-one, is it real enough so that you could tell whether or not I was lying to you?</s>
 <s id="30">So that was our goal.</s>
 <s id="31">About a year and a half ago, we set off to achieve this goal.</s>
 <s id="32">What I'm going to do now is take you basically on a little bit of a journey to see exactly what we had to do to get where we are.</s>
 <s id="33">We had to capture an enormous amount of data.</s>
 <s id="34">In fact, by the end of this thing, we had probably one of the largest facial data sets on the planet.</s>
 <s id="35">Of my face.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) Why me?</s>
 <s id="37">Well, I'll do just about anything for science.</s>
 <s id="38">I mean, look at me!</s>
 <s id="39">I mean, come on.</s>
 <s id="40">We had to first figure out what my face actually looked like.</s>
 <s id="41">Not just a photograph or a 3-D scan, but what it actually looked like in any photograph, how light interacts with my skin.</s>
 <s id="42">Luckily for us, about three blocks away from our Los Angeles studio is this place called ICT.</s>
 <s id="43">They're a research lab that's associated with the University of Southern California.</s>
 <s id="44">They have a device there, it's called the "light stage."</s>
 <s id="45">It has a zillion individually controlled lights and a whole bunch of cameras.</s>
 <s id="46">And with that, we can reconstruct my face under a myriad of lighting conditions.</s>
 <s id="47">We even captured the blood flow and how my face changes when I make expressions.</s>
 <s id="48">This let us build a model of my face that, quite frankly, is just amazing.</s>
 <s id="49">It's got an unfortunate level of detail, unfortunately.</s>
 <s id="50">(Laughter) You can see every pore, every wrinkle.</s>
 <s id="51">But we had to have that.</s>
 <s id="52">Reality is all about detail.</s>
 <s id="53">And without it, you miss it.</s>
 <s id="54">We are far from done, though.</s>
 <s id="55">This let us build a model of my face that looked like me.</s>
 <s id="56">But it didn't really move like me.</s>
 <s id="57">And that's where machine learning comes in.</s>
 <s id="58">And machine learning needs a ton of data.</s>
 <s id="59">So I sat down in front of some high-resolution motion-capturing device.</s>
 <s id="60">And also, we did this traditional motion capture with markers.</s>
 <s id="61">We created a whole bunch of images of my face and moving point clouds that represented that shapes of my face.</s>
 <s id="62">Man, I made a lot of expressions, I said different lines in different emotional states ...</s>
 <s id="63">We had to do a lot of capture with this.</s>
 <s id="64">Once we had this enormous amount of data, we built and trained deep neural networks.</s>
 <s id="65">And when we were finished with that, in 16 milliseconds, the neural network can look at my image and figure out everything about my face.</s>
 <s id="66">It can compute my expression, my wrinkles, my blood flow -- even how my eyelashes move.</s>
 <s id="67">This is then rendered and displayed up there with all the detail that we captured previously.</s>
 <s id="68">We're far from done.</s>
 <s id="69">This is very much a work in progress.</s>
 <s id="70">This is actually the first time we've shown it outside of our company.</s>
 <s id="71">And, you know, it doesn't look as convincing as we want; I've got wires coming out of the back of me, and there's a sixth-of-a-second delay between when we capture the video and we display it up there.</s>
 <s id="72">Sixth of a second -- that's crazy good!</s>
 <s id="73">But it's still why you're hearing a bit of an echo and stuff.</s>
 <s id="74">And you know, this machine learning stuff is brand-new to us, sometimes it's hard to convince to do the right thing, you know?</s>
 <s id="75">It goes a little sideways.</s>
 <s id="76">(Laughter) But why did we do this?</s>
 <s id="77">Well, there's two reasons, really.</s>
 <s id="78">First of all, it is just crazy cool.</s>
 <s id="79">(Laughter) How cool is it?</s>
 <s id="80">Well, with the push of a button, I can deliver this talk as a completely different character.</s>
 <s id="81">This is Elbor.</s>
 <s id="82">We put him together to test how this would work with a different appearance.</s>
 <s id="83">And the cool thing about this technology is that, while I've changed my character, the performance is still all me.</s>
 <s id="84">I tend to talk out of the right side of my mouth; so does Elbor.</s>
 <s id="85">(Laughter) Now, the second reason we did this, and you can imagine, is this is going to be great for film.</s>
 <s id="86">This is a brand-new, exciting tool for artists and directors and storytellers.</s>
 <s id="87">It's pretty obvious, right?</s>
 <s id="88">I mean, this is going to be really neat to have.</s>
 <s id="89">But also, now that we've built it, it's clear that this is going to go way beyond film.</s>
 <s id="90">But wait.</s>
 <s id="91">Didn't I just change my identity with the push of a button?</s>
 <s id="92">Isn't this like "deepfake" and face-swapping that you guys may have heard of?</s>
 <s id="93">Well, yeah.</s>
 <s id="94">In fact, we are using some of the same technology that deepfake is using.</s>
 <s id="95">Deepfake is 2-D and image based, while ours is full 3-D and way more powerful.</s>
 <s id="96">But they're very related.</s>
 <s id="97">And now I can hear you thinking, "Darn it!</s>
 <s id="98">I though I could at least trust and believe in video.</s>
 <s id="99">If it was live video, didn't it have to be true?"</s>
 <s id="100">Well, we know that's not really the case, right?</s>
 <s id="101">Even without this, there are simple tricks that you can do with video like how you frame a shot that can make it really misrepresent what's actually going on.</s>
 <s id="102">And I've been working in visual effects for a long time, and I've known for a long time that with enough effort, we can fool anyone about anything.</s>
 <s id="103">What this stuff and deepfake is doing is making it easier and more accessible to manipulate video, just like Photoshop did for manipulating images, some time ago.</s>
 <s id="104">I prefer to think about how this technology could bring humanity to other technology and bring us all closer together.</s>
 <s id="105">Now that you've seen this, think about the possibilities.</s>
 <s id="106">Right off the bat, you're going to see it in live events and concerts, like this.</s>
 <s id="107">Digital celebrities, especially with new projection technology, are going to be just like the movies, but alive and in real time.</s>
 <s id="108">And new forms of communication are coming.</s>
 <s id="109">You can already interact with DigiDoug in VR.</s>
 <s id="110">And it is eye-opening.</s>
 <s id="111">It's just like you and I are in the same room, even though we may be miles apart.</s>
 <s id="112">Heck, the next time you make a video call, you will be able to choose the version of you you want people to see.</s>
 <s id="113">It's like really, really good makeup.</s>
 <s id="114">I was scanned about a year and a half ago.</s>
 <s id="115">I've aged.</s>
 <s id="116">DigiDoug hasn't.</s>
 <s id="117">On video calls, I never have to grow old.</s>
 <s id="118">And as you can imagine, this is going to be used to give virtual assistants a body and a face.</s>
 <s id="119">A humanity.</s>
 <s id="120">I already love it that when I talk to virtual assistants, they answer back in a soothing, humanlike voice.</s>
 <s id="121">Now they'll have a face.</s>
 <s id="122">And you'll get all the nonverbal cues that make communication so much easier.</s>
 <s id="123">It's going to be really nice.</s>
 <s id="124">You'll be able to tell when a virtual assistant is busy or confused or concerned about something.</s>
 <s id="125">Now, I couldn't leave the stage without you actually being able to see my real face, so you can do some comparison.</s>
 <s id="126">So let me take off my helmet here.</s>
 <s id="127">Yeah, don't worry, it looks way worse than it feels.</s>
 <s id="128">(Laughter) So this is where we are.</s>
 <s id="129">Let me put this back on here.</s>
 <s id="130">(Laughter) Doink!</s>
 <s id="131">So this is where we are.</s>
 <s id="132">We're on the cusp of being able to interact with digital humans that are strikingly real, whether they're being controlled by a person or a machine.</s>
 <s id="133">And like all new technology these days, it's going to come with some serious and real concerns that we have to deal with.</s>
 <s id="134">But I am just so really excited about the ability to bring something that I've seen only in science fiction for my entire life into reality.</s>
 <s id="135">Communicating with computers will be like talking to a friend.</s>
 <s id="136">And talking to faraway friends will be like sitting with them together in the same room.</s>
 <s id="137">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="138">(Applause)</s>
