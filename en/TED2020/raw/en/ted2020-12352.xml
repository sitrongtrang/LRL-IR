 <s id="1">I think stairs may be one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements that an architect has to work with.</s>

  <s id="2.1">[Small thing.</s>
  <s id="2.2">Big idea.]</s>
  <s id="2.3">[David Rockwell on the Stairs] At its most basic, a stair is a way to get from point A to point B at different elevations.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">Stairs have a common language.</s>
 <s id="4">Treads, which is the thing that you walk on.</s>
 <s id="5">Riser, which is the vertical element that separates the two treads.</s>
 <s id="6">A lot of stairs have nosings that create a kind of edge.</s>
 <s id="7">And then, the connected piece is a stringer.</s>
 <s id="8">Those pieces, in different forms, make up all stairs.</s>
 <s id="9">I assume stairs came to be from the first time someone said, "I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock."</s>
 <s id="10">People climbed using whatever was available: stepped logs, ladders and natural pathways that were worn over time.</s>
 <s id="11">Some of the earliest staircases, like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá or the roads to Mount Tai in China, were a means of getting to a higher elevation, which people sought for worship or for protection.</s>
 <s id="12">As engineering has evolved, so has what's practical.</s>
 <s id="13">Stairs can be made from all kinds of material.</s>
 <s id="14">There are linear stairs, there are spiraled stairs.</s>
 <s id="15">Stairs can be indoors, they can be outdoors.</s>
 <s id="16">They clearly help us in an emergency.</s>
 <s id="17">But they're also a form of art in and of themselves.</s>
 <s id="18">As we move across a stairway, the form dictates our pacing, our feeling, our safety and our relationship and engagement with the space around us.</s>
 <s id="19">So for a second, think about stepping down a gradual, monumental staircase like the one in front of the New York Public Library.</s>
 <s id="20">From those steps, you have a view of the street and all the people around you, and your walk is slow and steady because the tread is so wide.</s>
 <s id="21">That's a totally different experience than going down the narrow staircase to, say, an old pub, where you spill into the room.</s>
 <s id="22">There, you encounter tall risers, so you move more quickly.</s>
 <s id="23">Stairs add enormous drama.</s>
 <s id="24">Think about how stairs signaled a grand entrance and were the star of that moment.</s>
 <s id="25">Stairs can even be heroic.</s>
 <s id="26">The staircase that remained standing after September 11th and the attack on the World Trade Center was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase," because it played such a central role in leading hundreds of people to safety.</s>
 <s id="27">But small stairs can have a huge impact, too.</s>
 <s id="28">The stoop is a place that invites neighbors to gather, blast music, and watch the city in motion.</s>
 <s id="29">It's fascinating to me that you see people wanting to hang out on the stairs.</s>
 <s id="30">I think they fill a deeply human need we have to inhabit a space more than just on the ground plane.</s>
 <s id="31">And so if you're able to sit halfway up there, you're in a kind of magical place.</s>
