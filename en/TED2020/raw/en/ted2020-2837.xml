 <s id="1">So, I'm afraid.</s>
 <s id="2">Right now, on this stage, I feel fear.</s>
 <s id="3">In my life, I ain't met many people that will readily admit when they are afraid.</s>
 <s id="4">And I think that's because deep down, they know how easy it spreads.</s>
 <s id="5">See, fear is like a disease.</s>
 <s id="6">When it moves, it moves like wildfire.</s>
 <s id="7">But what happens when, even in the face of that fear, you do what you've got to do?</s>
 <s id="8">That's called courage.</s>
 <s id="9">And just like fear, courage is contagious.</s>
 <s id="10">See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.</s>
 <s id="11">That's a small city across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri.</s>
 <s id="12">I have lived in and around St. Louis my entire life.</s>
 <s id="13">When Michael Brown, Jr., an ordinary teenager, was gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri -- another suburb, but north of St. Louis -- I remember thinking, he ain't the first, and he won't be the last young kid to lose his life to law enforcement.</s>
 <s id="14">But see, his death was different.</s>
 <s id="15">When Mike was killed, I remember the powers that be trying to use fear as a weapon.</s>
 <s id="16">The police response to a community in mourning was to use force to impose fear: fear of militarized police, imprisonment, fines.</s>
 <s id="17">The media even tried to make us afraid of each other by the way they spun the story.</s>
 <s id="18">And all of these things have worked in the past.</s>
 <s id="19">But like I said, this time it was different.</s>
 <s id="20">Michael Brown's death and the subsequent treatment of the community led to a string of protests in and around Ferguson and St. Louis.</s>
 <s id="21">When I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day, it was not out of courage; it was out of guilt.</s>
 <s id="22">See, I'm black.</s>
 <s id="23">I don't know if y'all noticed that.</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) But I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes away from Ferguson, and not go see.</s>
 <s id="25">So I got off my ass to go check it out.</s>
 <s id="26">When I got out there, I found something surprising.</s>
 <s id="27">I found anger; there was a lot of that.</s>
 <s id="28">But what I found more of was love.</s>
 <s id="29">People with love for themselves.</s>
 <s id="30">Love for their community.</s>
 <s id="31">And it was beautiful -- until the police showed up.</s>
 <s id="32">Then a new emotion was interjected into the conversation: fear.</s>
 <s id="33">Now, I'm not going to lie; when I saw those armored vehicles, and all that gear and all those guns and all those police I was terrified -- personally.</s>
 <s id="34">And when I looked around that crowd, I saw a lot of people that had the same thing going on.</s>
 <s id="35">But I also saw people with something else inside of them.</s>
 <s id="36">That was courage.</s>
 <s id="37">See, those people yelled, and they screamed, and they were not about to back down from the police.</s>
 <s id="38">They were past that point.</s>
 <s id="39">And then I could feel something in me changing, so I yelled and I screamed, and I noticed that everybody around me was doing the same thing.</s>
 <s id="40">And there was nothing like that feeling.</s>
 <s id="41">So I decided I wanted to do something more.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">I went home, I thought: I'm an artist.</s>
  <s id="42.2">I make shit.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">So I started making things specific to the protest, things that would be weapons in a spiritual war, things that would give people voice and things that would fortify them for the road ahead.</s>
 <s id="44">I did a project where I took pictures of the hands of protesters and put them up and down the boarded-up buildings and community shops.</s>
 <s id="45">My goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale.</s>
 <s id="46">And I think, for a minute at least, it did just that.</s>
 <s id="47">Then I thought, I want to uplift the stories of these people I was watching being courageous in the moment.</s>
 <s id="48">And myself and my friend, and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan did just that with our documentary, "Whose Streets?"</s>
 <s id="49">I kind of became a conduit for all of this courage that was given to me.</s>
 <s id="50">And I think that's part of our job as artists.</s>
 <s id="51">I think we should be conveyors of courage in the work that we do.</s>
 <s id="52">And I think that we are the wall between the normal folks and the people that use their power to spread fear and hate, especially in times like these.</s>
 <s id="53">So I'm going to ask you.</s>
 <s id="54">Y'all the movers and the shakers, you know, the thought leaders: What are you gonna do with the gifts that you've been given to break us from the fear the binds us every day?</s>
 <s id="55">Because, see, I'm afraid every day.</s>
 <s id="56">I can't remember a time when I wasn't.</s>
 <s id="57">But once I figured out that fear was not put in me to cripple me, it was there to protect me, and once I figured out how to use that fear, I found my power.</s>
 <s id="58">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="59">(Applause)</s>
