 <s id="1">I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar, who is a fellow poet.</s>
 <s id="2">And Kaveh found this photo online of the anatomical heart of a blue whale that scientists had hung on a hook from the ceiling, which is how they were able to observe that the heart of a blue whale is big enough that a person can stand up fully inside of it.</s>
 <s id="3">And when Kaveh shared this photo online, he did so with the caption, "This is another reminder that the universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing."</s>
 <s id="4">And when I first saw that, I was horrified.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">I was like, "Come on, man!</s>
  <s id="5.2">I'm trying to invent new metaphors!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">I'm trying to discover beauty that hasn't been discovered yet.</s>
 <s id="7">What do you mean, the universe is always going to get there before me?"</s>
 <s id="8">And I know this isn't a uniquely poet problem, but on days when the world feels especially big or especially impossible or especially full of grandeur, those are the days when I feel, "What do I possibly have to contribute to all of this?"</s>
 <s id="9">Not long ago, I saw this video that some of you may have seen.</s>
 <s id="10">It makes the internet rounds every couple of months.</s>
 <s id="11">There are these birds that are called starlings, and they fly in what's called a "murmuration," which is generally just a big cloud of birds.</s>
 <s id="12">And someone happened to catch a quick video on their phone of these starlings flying.</s>
 <s id="13">And at first, it's just an amorphous blob, and then there's a moment where the birds shift, and they form the shape of a starling in the sky!</s>
 <s id="14">(Laughter) And as soon as I saw it, I was like, (Gasps) "The universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing!"</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) Except, for the first time, it didn't fill me with despair.</s>
 <s id="16">Instead, I thought, "OK.</s>
 <s id="17">Maybe it's not my job to invent something new.</s>
 <s id="18">Maybe instead it's my job to listen to what the universe is showing me and to keep myself open to what the universe offers, so that when it's my turn, I can hold something to the light, just for a moment, just for as long as I have.</s>
 <s id="19">The universe has already written the poem that you were planning on writing.</s>
 <s id="20">And this is why you can do nothing but point at the flock of starlings whose bodies rise and fall in inherited choreography, swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain that, for one blistering moment, forms the unmistakeable shape of a giant bird flapping against the sky.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">It is why your mouth forms an "o" that is not a gasp, but rather, the beginning of, "Oh.</s>
  <s id="21.2">Of course."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">As in, of course the heart of a blue whale is as large as a house with chambers tall enough to fit a person standing.</s>
 <s id="23">Of course a fig becomes possible when a lady wasp lays her eggs inside a flower, dies and decomposes, the fruit, evidence of her transformation.</s>
 <s id="24">Sometimes, the poem is so bright, your silly language will not stick to it.</s>
 <s id="25">Sometimes, the poem is so true, nobody will believe you.</s>
 <s id="26">I am a bird made of birds.</s>
 <s id="27">This blue heart a house you can stand up inside of.</s>
 <s id="28">I am dying here inside this flower.</s>
 <s id="29">It is OK.</s>
 <s id="30">It is what I was put here to do.</s>
 <s id="31">Take this fruit.</s>
 <s id="32">It is what I have to offer.</s>
 <s id="33">It may not be first, or ever best, but it is the only way to be sure that I lived at all.</s>
 <s id="34">(Applause)</s>
