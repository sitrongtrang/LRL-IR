 <s id="1">As technology progresses, and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world.</s>
 <s id="2">And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case, as progress is simply a word for change, and with change you gain something, but you also lose something.</s>
 <s id="3">And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.</s>
 <s id="4">And that question is this.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">What time is it?</s>
  <s id="5.2">What time is it?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.</s>
 <s id="7">But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone?</s>
 <s id="8">How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?</s>
 <s id="9">How would you do it?</s>
 <s id="10">Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe.</s>
 <s id="11">So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.</s>
 <s id="12">But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.</s>
 <s id="13">It was the world's first popular computer.</s>
 <s id="14">And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.</s>
 <s id="15">So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type, the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.</s>
 <s id="16">The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.</s>
 <s id="17">And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.</s>
 <s id="18">If you were an educated child, you would know how to not only use the astrolabe, you would also know how to make an astrolabe.</s>
 <s id="19">And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language, was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.</s>
 <s id="20">Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391, to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.</s>
 <s id="21">And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.</s>
 <s id="22">And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection.</s>
 <s id="23">And basically, the concept is, how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.</s>
 <s id="24">The idea is actually relatively simple.</s>
 <s id="25">Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe, and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.</s>
 <s id="26">Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole, onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.</s>
 <s id="27">So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.</s>
 <s id="28">The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets correspond to an offset circle.</s>
 <s id="29">The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.</s>
 <s id="30">And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.</s>
 <s id="31">Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.</s>
 <s id="32">The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly.</s>
 <s id="33">There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate.</s>
  <s id="34.2">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">So how would you use this device?</s>
 <s id="36">Well, let me first back up for a moment.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">This is an astrolabe.</s>
  <s id="37.2">Pretty impressive, isn't it?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.</s>
 <s id="39">And you can see the different components.</s>
 <s id="40">This is the mater, the scales on the back.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">This is the rete.</s>
  <s id="41.2">Okay.</s>
  <s id="41.3">Do you see that?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">That's the movable part of the sky.</s>
 <s id="43">And in the back you can see a spider web pattern.</s>
 <s id="44">And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">This is a rule device.</s>
  <s id="45.2">And on the back are some other devices, measuring tools and scales, to be able to make some calculations.</s>
  <s id="45.3">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">You know, I've always wanted one of these.</s>
 <s id="47">For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.</s>
 <s id="48">And this one, this is a replica from a 15th-century device.</s>
 <s id="49">And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.</s>
 <s id="50">But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.</s>
 <s id="51">They are just incredibly expensive.</s>
 <s id="52">But let me show you how to work this device.</s>
 <s id="53">So let's go to step one.</s>
 <s id="54">First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.</s>
 <s id="55">So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">And there is a bright star called Deneb.</s>
  <s id="56.2">So let's select Deneb.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.</s>
 <s id="58">So, step two, I hold the device up, and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now.</s>
 <s id="59">And then I measure its altitude.</s>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">So, it's about 26 degrees.</s>
  <s id="60.2">You can't see it from over there.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="61">Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">Deneb is there.</s>
  <s id="62.2">I can tell.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">Step four is I then move the rete, move the sky, so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back.</s>
 <s id="64">Okay, so when that happens everything lines up.</s>
 <p id="p65">
  <s id="65.1">I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky.</s>
  <s id="65.2">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="66">So, it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands.</s>
 <s id="67">And then finally, I take a rule, and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here.</s>
 <p id="p68">
  <s id="68.1">Right.</s>
  <s id="68.2">So, that's how the device is used.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">(Laughter) So, I know what you're thinking: "That's a lot of work, isn't it?</s>
  <s id="69.2">Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.</s>
 <s id="71">But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision.</s>
 <s id="72">The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky.</s>
 <s id="73">He would know where things would fit in the sky.</s>
 <s id="74">He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.</s>
 <s id="75">He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.</s>
 <s id="76">And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens.</s>
 <s id="77">So, in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances.</s>
 <s id="78">So, affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it.</s>
 <s id="79">And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us, to connect to the night sky, to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together.</s>
 <p id="p80">
  <s id="80.1">So, that's just one use.</s>
  <s id="80.2">Incredible, there is probably 350, 400 uses.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="81">In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer.</s>
 <s id="82">On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.</s>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">You can survey with it.</s>
  <s id="83.2">The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="84">It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.</s>
 <s id="85">And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.</s>
 <s id="86">Astrolabes have an incredible history.</s>
 <s id="87">They are over 2,000 years old.</s>
 <s id="88">The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C.</s>
 <s id="89">And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.</s>
 <p id="p90">
  <s id="90.1">There is portable ones.</s>
  <s id="90.2">There is large display ones.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="91">And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art.</s>
 <s id="92">There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable.</s>
 <s id="93">Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.</s>
 <s id="94">So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.</s>
 <s id="95">And advancing retes became cultural emblems.</s>
 <s id="96">This is one from Oxford.</s>
 <s id="97">And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical, and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.</s>
 <p id="p98">
  <s id="98.1">How cool is that?</s>
  <s id="98.2">This is just amazing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="99">So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?</s>
 <p id="p100">
  <s id="100.1">Probably not one made of brass.</s>
  <s id="100.2">He would have one made out of wood, or paper.</s>
  <s id="100.3">And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="101">So, what does the astrolabe inspire?</s>
 <s id="102">Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago.</s>
 <s id="103">It's just an incredible device.</s>
 <s id="104">Every technology advances.</s>
 <s id="105">Every technology is transformed and moved by others.</s>
 <s id="106">And what we gain with a new technology, of course, is precision and accuracy.</s>
 <s id="107">But what we lose, I think, is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky, a sense of context.</s>
 <s id="108">Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky, is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is.</s>
 <s id="109">So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.</s>
 <s id="110">And so, what can you learn from these devices?</s>
 <s id="111">Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world.</s>
 <s id="112">And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together, and also how we connect to the world.</s>
 <s id="113">Thanks very much.</s>
 <s id="114">(Applause)</s>
