 <s id="1">Insulin pumps improve the lives of many of the 415 million people with diabetes around the world by monitoring blood sugar, delivering insulin, and preventing the need for constant finger-pricking and blood testing.</s>
 <s id="2">These small machines include a pump and a needle, which can sense glucose levels, feed back to the pump, and then calculate how much insulin to deliver through the needle.</s>
 <s id="3">But they have a catch: they’re temporary.</s>
 <s id="4">Within a few days, glucose sensors have to be moved and replaced.</s>
 <s id="5">And it’s not just glucose monitors and insulin pumps that have this problem, but all bodily implants, at different time scales.</s>
 <s id="6">Plastic prosthetic knees have to be replaced after about 20 years.</s>
 <s id="7">Other implants, such as those used for cosmetic reasons, can meet the same fate in about 10.</s>
 <s id="8">That isn’t just a nuisance: it can be expensive and risky.</s>
 <s id="9">This inconvenience happens because of our bodies’ immune systems.</s>
 <s id="10">Honed by several hundred million years of evolution, these defensive fronts have become exceptionally good at identifying foreign objects.</s>
 <s id="11">Our immune systems boast an impressive arsenal of tools to tackle, intercept, and destroy anything they believe shouldn’t be there.</s>
 <s id="12">But the consequence of this constant surveillance is that our bodies treat helpful implants, like insulin pumps, with the same suspicion as they would a harmful virus or bacteria.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">As soon as the insulin pump has been implanted in the skin, its presence triggers what’s known as a “foreign body response.”</s>
  <s id="13.2">This starts with free-floating proteins that stick themselves to the surface of the implant.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">Those proteins include antibodies, which attempt to neutralize the new object and send out a signal that calls other immune cells to the site to strengthen the attack.</s>
 <s id="15">Early-responding inflammatory cells, like neutrophils and macrophages, respond to the emergency call.</s>
 <s id="16">Neutrophils release little granules filled with enzymes that try to break down the surface of the insulin pump’s needle.</s>
 <s id="17">Macrophages secrete enzymes too, together with nitric oxide radicals, which create a chemical reaction that degrades the object over time.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">If the macrophages are unable to dispatch the foreign body rapidly, they fuse together, forming a mass of cells called a “giant cell.”</s>
  <s id="18.2">At the same time, cells called fibroblasts travel to the site and begin to deposit layers of dense connective tissue.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">Those enclose the needle that the pump uses to deliver insulin and test for glucose levels.</s>
 <s id="20">Over time this scaffolding builds up, forming a scar around the implant.</s>
 <s id="21">The scar functions as an almost impenetrable wall that might start to block vital interactions between the body and the implant.</s>
 <s id="22">For example, scarring around pacemakers can interrupt the electrical transmission that’s crucial for their functioning.</s>
 <s id="23">Synthetic knee joints may give off particles as they’re worn down, causing immune cells to inflame around these fragments.</s>
 <s id="24">Tragically, the immune system’s attack can even be life-threatening.</s>
 <s id="25">However, researchers are finding ways to trick the immune system into accepting the new devices we introduce into our bodily tissues.</s>
 <s id="26">We’ve discovered that coating implants with certain chemicals and drugs can dampen the immune response.</s>
 <s id="27">Those basically make the implants invisible to the immune system.</s>
 <s id="28">We’re also making more implants out of natural materials and in forms that directly mimic tissues, so that the body launches a weaker attack than it would if it came across a completely artificial implant.</s>
 <s id="29">Some medical treatments involve implants designed to regenerate lost or damaged tissues.</s>
 <s id="30">In those cases, we can design the implants to contain ingredients that will release specific signals, and carefully tailor our bodies’ immune reactions.</s>
 <s id="31">In the future, this way of working alongside the immune system could help us develop completely artificial organs, totally integrative prostheses, and self-healing wound therapies.</s>
 <s id="32">These treatments might one day revolutionize medicine– and transform, forever, the bodies we live in.</s>
