 <s id="1">My mother was a philanthropist.</s>
 <s id="2">And now I know you're asking -- let me give you the answer: yes, a little bit like Melinda Gates -- (Laughter) but with a lot less money.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) She carried out her philanthropy in our community through a practice we call, "isirika."</s>
 <s id="4">She supported the education of scores of children and invited many to live with us in our home in order to access schools.</s>
 <s id="5">She mobilized resources for building the local health clinic and the maternity wing is named in memory of her.</s>
 <s id="6">But most important, she was endeared by the community for her organizing skills, because she organized the community, and specifically women, to find solutions to anything that was needed.</s>
 <s id="7">She did all of this through isirika.</s>
 <s id="8">Let me repeat that word for you again: isirika.</s>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">Now it's your turn.</s>
  <s id="9.2">Say it with me.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">(Audience) Isirika.</s>
 <s id="11">Musimbi Kanyoro: Thank you.</s>
 <s id="12">That word is in my language, Maragoli, spoken in western Kenya, and now you speak my language.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) So, isirika is a pragmatic way of life that embraces charity, services and philanthropy all together.</s>
 <s id="14">The essence of isirika is to make it clear to everybody that you're your sister's keeper -- and yes, you're your brother's keeper.</s>
 <s id="15">Mutual responsibility for caring for one another.</s>
 <s id="16">A literal, simple English translation would be equal generosity, but the deep philosophical meaning is caring, together, for one another.</s>
 <s id="17">So how does isirika really happen?</s>
 <s id="18">I grew up in a farming community in western Kenya.</s>
 <s id="19">I remember vividly the many times that neighbors would go to a neighbor's home -- a sick neighbor's home -- and harvest their crop for them.</s>
 <s id="20">I tagged alongside with my mother to community events and to women's events, and had the conversation about vaccinations in school, building the health center and really big things -- renewing seeds for the next planting season.</s>
 <s id="21">And often, the community would come together to contribute money to send a neighbor's child to school -- not only in the country but to universities abroad as well.</s>
 <s id="22">And so we have a surgeon.</s>
 <s id="23">The first surgeon in my country came from that rural village.</s>
 <s id="24">(Applause) So ...</s>
 <s id="25">what isirika did was to be inclusive.</s>
 <s id="26">We as children would stand alongside the adults and give our contributions of money, and our names were inscripted in the community book just like every adult.</s>
 <s id="27">And then I grew up, went to universities back at home and abroad, obtained a few degrees here and there, became organized and took up international jobs, working in development, humanitarian work and philanthropy.</s>
 <s id="28">And very soon, isirika began to become small.</s>
 <s id="29">It dissipated and then just disappeared.</s>
 <s id="30">In each place, I gained a new vocabulary.</s>
 <s id="31">The vocabulary of donors and recipients.</s>
 <s id="32">The vocabulary of measuring impact, return on investment ...</s>
 <s id="33">projects and programs.</s>
 <s id="34">Communities such as my childhood community became referred to as "poor, vulnerable populations."</s>
 <s id="35">Those are the communities of which literature speaks about as living on less than a dollar a day, and they become the targets for poverty eradication programs.</s>
 <s id="36">And by the way, they are the targets of our first United Nations' sustainable development goal.</s>
 <s id="37">Now, I'm really interested that we find solutions to poverty and to the world's other many big problems because they do exist.</s>
 <s id="38">I however think that we could do a better job, and we could do a better job by embracing isirika.</s>
 <s id="39">So let me tell you how.</s>
 <s id="40">First, isirika affirms common humanity.</s>
 <s id="41">For whatever that you do, you begin from the premise that you're human together.</s>
 <s id="42">When you begin that you're human together, you see each other differently.</s>
 <s id="43">You don't see a refugee first and you don't see a woman first and you don't see a person with disability first.</s>
 <s id="44">You see a human being first.</s>
 <s id="45">That is the essence of seeing a person first.</s>
 <s id="46">And when you do that, you value their ideas, you value their contribution -- small or big.</s>
 <s id="47">And you value what they bring to the table.</s>
 <s id="48">That is the essence of isirika.</s>
 <s id="49">I just want to imagine what it would look like if everyone in this room -- a medical doctor, a parent, a lawyer, a philanthropist, whatever you are -- if you embraced isirika and made it your default.</s>
 <s id="50">What could we achieve for each other?</s>
 <s id="51">What could we achieve for humanity?</s>
 <s id="52">What could we achieve for peace issues?</s>
 <s id="53">What could we achieve for medical science?</s>
 <s id="54">Let me give you a couple of hints, because I'm going to ask you to accompany me in this process of rebuilding and reclaiming isirika with me.</s>
 <s id="55">First, you have to have faith that we are one humanity, we have one planet and we don't have two choices about that.</s>
 <s id="56">So there's not going to be a wall that is high enough to separate humanity.</s>
 <s id="57">So give up the walls.</s>
 <s id="58">Give them up.</s>
 <s id="59">(Applause) And we don't have a planet B to go to.</s>
 <s id="60">So that's really important.</s>
 <s id="61">Make that clear; move onto the next stage.</s>
 <s id="62">The second stage: remember, in isirika, every idea counts.</s>
 <s id="63">Bridges have big posters and they have nails.</s>
 <s id="64">Every idea counts -- small or big counts.</s>
 <s id="65">And third, isirika affirms that those who have more really enjoy the privilege of giving more.</s>
 <s id="66">It is a privilege to give more.</s>
 <s id="67">(Applause) And this is the time for women to give more for women.</s>
 <s id="68">It is the time to give more for women.</s>
 <s id="69">Our parents, when they brought in other children to live with us, they didn't ask our permission.</s>
 <s id="70">They made it clear that they had a responsibility because they had gone to school and they had an earning.</s>
 <s id="71">And they made it clear that we should understand that their prosperity was not our entitlement, and I think that's good wisdom from isirika.</s>
 <s id="72">We could use that wisdom today, I think, in every culture, in every place, passing to the next generation what we could do together.</s>
 <s id="73">I have, over the years, encountered isirika in many places, but what gives me really the passion today to embrace isirika is the work that I do with women all over the world through the Global Fund for Women, though women's funds and through women's movements globally.</s>
 <s id="74">If you work with women, you change every day because you experience them living isirika together in what they do.</s>
 <s id="75">In the work that I do, we trust women leaders and their ideas.</s>
 <s id="76">And we support them with funding so that they can expand, they can grow and they can thrive within their own communities.</s>
 <s id="77">A woman in 1990 came to the Global Fund with a big idea -- a woman from Mexico by the name of Lucero Gonz√°lez.</s>
 <s id="78">She wanted to begin a fund that would support a movement that would be rooted in the communities in Mexico.</s>
 <s id="79">And she received a grant of 7,500 US dollars.</s>
 <s id="80">Today, 25 years later, Semillas, the name of the fund, has raised and spent, within the community, 17.8 million dollars.</s>
 <s id="81">(Applause) They have impacted over two million people, and they work with a group of 600,000 women in Mexico.</s>
 <s id="82">During the recent earthquake, they were so well rooted that they could quickly assess within the community and with others, what were the short-term needs and what were the long-term needs.</s>
 <s id="83">And I tell you, long after the lights have gone off Mexico, Semillas will be there with the communities, with the women, for a very long time.</s>
 <s id="84">And that's what I'm talking about: when we are able to support the ideas of communities that are rooted within their own setting.</s>
 <s id="85">Thirty years ago, there was very little funding that went directly to women's hands in their communities.</s>
 <s id="86">Today we celebrate 168 women's funds all over the world, 100 of which are in this country.</s>
 <s id="87">And they support -- (Applause) they support grassroots women's organizations -- community organizations under the leadership of girls and women, and together we have been able, collectively, to give a billion dollars to women and girls-led organizations.</s>
 <s id="88">(Applause) But the challenge begins today.</s>
 <s id="89">The challenge begins today because we see women everywhere organizing as isirika, including women organizing as isirika in TED.</s>
 <s id="90">Because isirika is the evergreen wisdom that lives in communities.</s>
 <s id="91">You find it in indigenous communities, in rural communities.</s>
 <s id="92">And what it really ingrains in people is that ability to trust and to move the agenda ahead.</s>
 <s id="93">So, three things that I have learned that I want to share with you through my work.</s>
 <s id="94">One: if you want to solve the world's biggest problems, invest in women and girls.</s>
 <s id="95">(Applause) Not only do they expand the investment, but they care for everyone in the community.</s>
 <s id="96">Not only their needs but the needs of their children, the needs of the rest of the community, the needs of the elderly, and most important, they protect themselves -- which is really important -- and they protect their communities.</s>
 <s id="97">Women who know how to protect themselves know what it means to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="98">And the second reason that I'm asking you to invest in women and girls is because this is the smartest thing you could ever do at this particular time.</s>
 <s id="99">And if we are going to have over 350 trillion dollars by 2030, those dollars need to be in the hands of women.</s>
 <s id="100">And so I grew up with isirika.</s>
 <s id="101">My mother was isirika.</s>
 <s id="102">She was not a project or a program.</s>
 <s id="103">And now, I pass that to you.</s>
 <s id="104">That you will be able to share this with your families, with your friends and with your community, and embrace isirika as a way of living -- as a pragmatic way of living.</s>
 <s id="105">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="106">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="107">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="108">(Applause)</s>
