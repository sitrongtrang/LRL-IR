 <s id="1">Which is the hardest word to translate in this sentence?</s>
 <s id="2">"Know" is easy to translate.</s>
 <s id="3">"Pep rally" doesn't have a direct analog in a lot of languages and cultures, but can be approximated.</s>
 <s id="4">But the hardest word there is actually one of the smallest: "you."</s>
 <s id="5">As simple as it seems, it's often impossible to accurately translate "you" without knowing a lot more about the situation where it's being said.</s>
 <s id="6">To start with, how familiar are you with the person you're talking to?</s>
 <s id="7">Many cultures have different levels of formality.</s>
 <s id="8">A close friend, someone much older or much younger, a stranger, a boss.</s>
 <s id="9">These all may be slightly different "you's."</s>
 <s id="10">In many languages, the pronoun reflects these differences through what's known as the T–V distinction.</s>
 <s id="11">In French, for example, you would say "tu" when talking to your friend at school, but "vous" when addressing your teacher.</s>
 <s id="12">Even English once had something similar.</s>
 <s id="13">Remember the old-timey "thou?"</s>
 <s id="14">Ironically, it was actually the informal pronoun for people you're close with, while "you" was the formal and polite version.</s>
 <s id="15">That distinction was lost when the English decided to just be polite all the time.</s>
 <s id="16">But the difficulty in translating "you" doesn't end there.</s>
 <s id="17">In languages like Hausa or Korana, the "you" form depends on the listener's gender.</s>
 <s id="18">In many more, it depends on whether they are one or many, such as with German "Du" or "ihr."</s>
 <s id="19">Even in English, some dialects use words like "y'all" or "youse" the same way.</s>
 <s id="20">Some plural forms, like the French "vous" and Russian "Вы" are also used for a single person to show that the addressee is that much more important, much like the royal "we."</s>
 <s id="21">And a few languages even have a specific form for addressing exactly two people, like Slovenian "vidva."</s>
 <s id="22">If that wasn't complicated enough, formality, number, and gender can all come into play at the same time.</s>
 <s id="23">In Spanish, "tú" is unisex informal singular, "usted" is unisex formal singular, "vosotros" is masculine informal plural, "vosotras" is feminine informal plural, and "ustedes" is the unisex formal plural.</s>
 <s id="24">Phew!</s>
 <s id="25">After all that, it may come as a relief that some languages often leave out the second person pronoun.</s>
 <s id="26">In languages like Romanian and Portuguese, the pronoun can be dropped from sentences because it's clearly implied by the way the verbs are conjugated.</s>
 <s id="27">And in languages like Korean, Thai, and Chinese, pronouns can be dropped without any grammatical hints.</s>
 <s id="28">Speakers often would rather have the listener guess the pronoun from context than use the wrong one and risk being seen as rude.</s>
 <s id="29">So if you're ever working as a translator and come across this sentence without any context: "You and you, no, not you, you, your job is to translate 'you' for yourselves" ...</s>
 <s id="30">Well, good luck.</s>
 <s id="31">And to the volunteer community who will be translating this video into multiple languages: Sorry about that!</s>
