 <s id="1">You’re on an airplane when you feel a sudden jolt.</s>
 <s id="2">Outside your window nothing seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air in the atmosphere.</s>
 <s id="3">Although it may not comfort you to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the prevailing mysteries of physics.</s>
 <s id="4">After more than a century of studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few answers for how it works and affects the world around us.</s>
 <s id="5">And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system that has moving fluids.</s>
 <s id="6">That includes the airflow in your respiratory tract.</s>
 <s id="7">The blood moving through your arteries.</s>
 <s id="8">And the coffee in your cup, as you stir it.</s>
 <s id="9">Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore and the gusts of plasma in our sun.</s>
 <s id="10">Understanding precisely how this phenomenon works would have a bearing on so many aspects of our lives.</s>
 <s id="11">Here’s what we do know.</s>
 <s id="12">Liquids and gases usually have two types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable and smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed of seemingly unorganized swirls.</s>
 <s id="13">Imagine an incense stick.</s>
 <s id="14">The laminar flow of unruffled smoke at the base is steady and easy to predict.</s>
 <s id="15">Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes to something chaotic.</s>
 <s id="16">That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain characteristics in common.</s>
 <s id="17">Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic.</s>
 <s id="18">That’s different from being random.</s>
 <s id="19">Rather, this means that turbulence is very sensitive to disruptions.</s>
 <s id="20">A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into completely different results.</s>
 <s id="21">That makes it nearly impossible to predict what will happen, even with a lot of information about the current state of a system.</s>
 <s id="22">Another important characteristic of turbulence is the different scales of motion that these flows display.</s>
 <s id="23">Turbulent flows have many differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of different sizes and shapes.</s>
 <s id="24">All those differently-sized eddies interact with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is transformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade."</s>
 <s id="25">So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen?</s>
 <s id="26">In every flowing liquid or gas there are two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity.</s>
 <s id="27">Inertia is the tendency of fluids to keep moving, which causes instability.</s>
 <s id="28">Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead.</s>
 <s id="29">In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins.</s>
 <s id="30">Less viscous substances like water or air are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that develop into turbulence.</s>
 <s id="31">We measure where a flow falls on that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s inertia and its viscosity.</s>
 <s id="32">The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that turbulence will occur.</s>
 <s id="33">Honey being poured into a cup, for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1.</s>
 <s id="34">The same set up with water has a Reynolds number that’s closer to 10,000.</s>
 <s id="35">The Reynolds number is useful for understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations.</s>
 <s id="36">For example, the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the earth’s rotation.</s>
 <s id="37">Or take relatively simple things like the drag on buildings and cars.</s>
 <s id="38">We can model those thanks to many experiments and empirical evidence.</s>
 <s id="39">But physicists want to be able to predict them through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits of planets or electromagnetic fields.</s>
 <s id="40">Most scientists think that getting there will rely on statistics and increased computing power.</s>
 <s id="41">Extremely high-speed computer simulations of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could lead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions across different situations.</s>
 <s id="42">Other scientists think that the phenomenon is so complex that such a full-fledged theory isn’t ever going to be possible.</s>
 <s id="43">Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence could have huge positive impacts.</s>
 <s id="44">That would include more efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for catastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate hurricanes away.</s>
 <s id="45">And, of course, smoother rides for millions of airline passengers.</s>
