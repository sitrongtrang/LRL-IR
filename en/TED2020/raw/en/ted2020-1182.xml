 <s id="1">The Highline is an old, elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.</s>
 <s id="2">And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Ave.</s>
 <s id="3">And it became known as "Death Avenue" because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front, and he became known as the "West Side Cowboy."</s>
 <s id="4">But even with a cowboy, about one person a month was killed and run over.</s>
 <s id="5">So they elevated it.</s>
 <s id="6">They built it 30 ft. in the air, right through the middle of the city.</s>
 <s id="7">But with the rise of interstate trucking, it was used less and less.</s>
 <s id="8">And by 1980, the last train rode.</s>
 <s id="9">It was a train loaded with frozen turkeys -- they say, at Thanksgiving -- from the meatpacking district.</s>
 <s id="10">And then it was abandoned.</s>
 <s id="11">And I live in the neighborhood, and I first read about it in the New York Times, in an article that said it was going to be demolished.</s>
 <s id="12">And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it and I could volunteer, but I realized no one was doing anything.</s>
 <s id="13">I went to my first community board meeting -- which I'd never been to one before -- and sat next to another guy named Joshua David, who's a travel writer.</s>
 <s id="14">And at the end of the meeting, we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project; most people wanted to tear it down.</s>
 <s id="15">So we exchanged business cards, and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization, Friends of the High Line.</s>
 <s id="16">And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition, but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.</s>
 <s id="17">And what first attracted me, or interested me, was this view from the street -- which is this steel structure, sort of rusty, this industrial relic.</s>
 <s id="18">But when I went up on top, it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.</s>
 <s id="19">And that's really where we started, the idea coalesced around, let's make this a park, and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape.</s>
 <s id="20">At the time, there was a lot of opposition.</s>
 <s id="21">Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.</s>
 <s id="22">I'm going to fast-forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of community engagement.</s>
 <s id="23">Mayor Bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive, but we still had to make the economic case.</s>
 <s id="24">This was after 9/11; the city was in tough times.</s>
 <s id="25">So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case.</s>
 <s id="26">And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.</s>
 <s id="27">We thought it would cost 100 million dollars to build.</s>
 <s id="28">So far it's cost about 150 million.</s>
 <s id="29">And the main case was, this is going to make good economic sense for the city.</s>
 <s id="30">So we said over a 20-year time period, the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">That was enough.</s>
  <s id="31.2">It really got the city behind it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">It turns out we were wrong on that.</s>
 <s id="33">Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars, or will create about a half a billion dollars, in tax revenues for the city.</s>
 <s id="34">We did a design competition, selected a design team.</s>
 <s id="35">We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that wildscape.</s>
 <s id="36">There's three sections.</s>
 <s id="37">We opened the fist section in 2009.</s>
 <s id="38">It's been successful beyond our dreams.</s>
 <s id="39">Last year we had about two million people, which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.</s>
 <s id="40">This is one of my favorite features in section one.</s>
 <s id="41">It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.</s>
 <s id="42">And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.</s>
 <s id="43">The other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value; it's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architecture.</s>
 <s id="44">There's a point, you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari.</s>
 <s id="45">And the Whitney is moving downtown and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line.</s>
 <s id="46">And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.</s>
 <s id="47">And they're going to break ground in May.</s>
 <s id="48">And we've already started construction on section two.</s>
 <s id="49">This is one of my favorite features, this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line, running through a canopy of trees.</s>
 <s id="50">The High Line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've taken a playful take where, instead of framing advertisements, it's going to frame people in views of the city.</s>
 <s id="51">This was just installed last month.</s>
 <s id="52">And then the last section was going to go around the rail yards, which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan.</s>
 <s id="53">And the city has planned -- for better or for worse -- 12 million square-feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around.</s>
 <s id="54">But what really, I think, makes the High Line special is the people.</s>
 <s id="55">And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building, I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it, because I fell in love with that wildscape -- and how could you recreate that magic?</s>
 <s id="56">But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that, to me, makes it so special.</s>
 <s id="57">Just one quick example is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line.</s>
 <s id="58">And I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands; we just don't do that outside.</s>
 <s id="59">But you see that happening on the High Line, and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other.</s>
 <s id="60">Thanks.</s>
 <s id="61">(Applause)</s>
