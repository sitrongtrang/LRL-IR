 <s id="1">What drives someone to kill in cold blood?</s>
 <s id="2">What goes through the murderer’s mind?</s>
 <s id="3">And what kind of a society breeds such people?</s>
 <s id="4">Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky took these questions up in what would become one of the best-known works of Russian literature: "Crime and Punishment."</s>
 <s id="5">First serialized in a literary magazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg.</s>
 <s id="6">Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run out of funds to continue his studies.</s>
 <s id="7">Letters from his rural home only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and sister have sacrificed for his success.</s>
 <s id="8">Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan to murder and rob her.</s>
 <s id="9">But the impact of carrying out this unthinkable act proves to be more than he was prepared for.</s>
 <s id="10">Though the novel is sometimes cited as one of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil.</s>
 <s id="11">From dank taverns to dilapidated apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose.</s>
 <s id="12">We’re introduced to characters such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged and lecherous nobleman.</s>
 <s id="13">As Raskolnikov’s own family arrives in town, their moral innocence stands in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow increasingly intertwined.</s>
 <s id="14">This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life experiences and evolving ideas.</s>
 <s id="15">As a young writer who left behind a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government.</s>
 <s id="16">Upon exposure, members of this group, including Dostoyevsky, were arrested.</s>
 <s id="17">Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution and last-minute pardon from the Tsar.</s>
 <s id="18">Dostoyevsky spent the next four years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854.</s>
 <s id="19">The experience left him with a far more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward spiritual concerns.</s>
 <s id="20">In the 1864 novella "Notes from Underground," he expounded on his belief that utopian Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory yearnings of the human soul.</s>
 <s id="21">"Crime and Punishment" was conceived and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes.</s>
 <s id="22">In many ways, the novel follows a common narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and corrupted by the dangers of urban life.</s>
 <s id="23">But its social critique cuts far deeper.</s>
 <s id="24">Raskolnikov rationalizes that his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society.</s>
 <s id="25">In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s contemporary intellectuals.</s>
 <s id="26">And in believing that his intelligence allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from his own humanity.</s>
 <s id="27">Yet although the book is deeply concerned with morality, "Crime and Punishment" never comes across as merely moralizing, with each character given their own distinctive and convincing voice.</s>
 <s id="28">One of the most remarkable things about "Crime and Punishment" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder being revealed in the first act.</s>
 <s id="29">Raskolnikov’s crime is clear.</s>
 <s id="30">But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s gripping account of the ensuing social and psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption.</s>
