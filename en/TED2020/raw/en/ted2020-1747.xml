 <s id="1">So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw.</s>
 <s id="2">Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things, like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid, but at the time this was really doomsday.</s>
 <s id="3">This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.</s>
 <s id="4">The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots.</s>
 <s id="5">And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.</s>
 <s id="6">So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still.</s>
 <s id="7">And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything.</s>
 <s id="8">And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely.</s>
 <s id="9">But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.</s>
 <s id="10">And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">So I did.</s>
  <s id="11.2">I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">I was making all these scribble pictures.</s>
 <s id="13">And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.</s>
 <s id="14">And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art.</s>
 <s id="15">I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted.</s>
 <s id="16">Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole.</s>
 <s id="17">So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.</s>
 <s id="18">I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons.</s>
 <s id="19">This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.</s>
 <s id="20">At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.</s>
 <s id="21">I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have.</s>
 <s id="22">I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.</s>
 <s id="23">I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at.</s>
 <s id="24">So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies.</s>
 <s id="25">And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box.</s>
 <s id="26">But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.</s>
 <s id="27">The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump.</s>
 <s id="28">And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.</s>
 <s id="29">And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.</s>
 <s id="30">But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before.</s>
 <s id="31">And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.</s>
 <s id="32">Embrace the shake.</s>
 <s id="33">And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it.</s>
 <s id="34">I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations?</s>
 <s id="35">What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?</s>
 <s id="36">At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50.</s>
 <s id="37">Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents.</s>
 <s id="38">It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless.</s>
 <s id="39">I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?</s>
 <s id="40">So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops?</s>
  <s id="41.2">(Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">(Laughter) (Applause) Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art?</s>
 <s id="43">So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.</s>
 <s id="44">I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment.</s>
 <s id="45">Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.</s>
 <s id="46">(Applause) Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it?</s>
 <s id="47">This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art.</s>
 <s id="48">This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.</s>
 <s id="49">In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches.</s>
 <s id="50">(Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.</s>
 <s id="51">I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food -- (Laughter) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine.</s>
 <s id="52">The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.</s>
 <s id="53">So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image.</s>
 <s id="54">So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.</s>
 <s id="55">It was destroyed before it ever existed.</s>
 <s id="56">In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display.</s>
 <s id="57">What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.</s>
 <s id="58">It did not happen overnight.</s>
 <s id="59">There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing.</s>
 <s id="60">But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this.</s>
 <s id="61">As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections.</s>
 <s id="62">And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.</s>
 <s id="63">I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever.</s>
 <s id="64">When I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions, instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit, I gave up.</s>
 <s id="65">And what if I didn't embrace the shake?</s>
 <s id="66">Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills.</s>
 <s id="67">It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.</s>
 <s id="68">Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.</s>
 <s id="69">Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world.</s>
 <s id="70">Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life.</s>
 <s id="71">Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease.</s>
 <s id="72">(Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate.</s>
 <s id="73">Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.</s>
 <s id="74">And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation.</s>
 <s id="75">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="76">(Applause)</s>
