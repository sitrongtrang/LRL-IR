 <s id="1">In the late 19th century, scientists were trying to solve a mystery.</s>
 <s id="2">They found that if they had a vacuum tube like this one and applied a high voltage across it, something strange happened.</s>
 <s id="3">They called them cathode rays.</s>
 <s id="4">But the question was: What were they made of?</s>
 <s id="5">In England, the 19th-century physicist J.J. Thompson conducted experiments using magnets and electricity, like this.</s>
 <s id="6">And he came to an incredible revelation.</s>
 <s id="7">These rays were made of negatively charged particles around 2,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom, the smallest thing they knew.</s>
 <s id="8">So Thompson had discovered the first subatomic particle, which we now call electrons.</s>
 <s id="9">Now, at the time, this seemed to be a completely impractical discovery.</s>
 <s id="10">I mean, Thompson didn't think there were any applications of electrons.</s>
 <s id="11">Around his lab in Cambridge, he used to like to propose a toast: "To the electron.</s>
 <s id="12">May it never be of use to anybody."</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) He was strongly in favor of doing research out of sheer curiosity, to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world.</s>
 <s id="14">And what he found did cause a revolution in science.</s>
 <s id="15">But it also caused a second, unexpected revolution in technology.</s>
 <s id="16">Today, I'd like to make a case for curiosity-driven research, because without it, none of the technologies I'll talk about today would have been possible.</s>
 <s id="17">Now, what Thompson found here has actually changed our view of reality.</s>
 <s id="18">I mean, I think I'm standing on a stage, and you think you're sitting in a seat.</s>
 <s id="19">But that's just the electrons in your body pushing back against the electrons in the seat, opposing the force of gravity.</s>
 <s id="20">You're not even really touching the seat.</s>
 <s id="21">You're hovering ever so slightly above it.</s>
 <s id="22">But in many ways, our modern society was actually built on this discovery.</s>
 <s id="23">I mean, these tubes were the start of electronics.</s>
 <s id="24">And then for many years, most of us actually had one of these, if you remember, in your living room, in cathode-ray tube televisions.</s>
 <s id="25">But -- I mean, how impoverished would our lives be if the only invention that had come from here was the television?</s>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) Thankfully, this tube was just a start, because something else happens when the electrons here hit the piece of metal inside the tube.</s>
 <s id="27">Let me show you.</s>
 <s id="28">Pop this one back on.</s>
 <s id="29">So as the electrons screech to a halt inside the metal, their energy gets thrown out again in a form of high-energy light, which we call X-rays.</s>
 <s id="30">(Buzzing) (Buzzing) And within 15 years of discovering the electron, these X-rays were being used to make images inside the human body, helping soldiers' lives being saved by surgeons, who could then find pieces of bullets and shrapnel inside their bodies.</s>
 <s id="31">But there's no way we could have come up with that technology by asking scientists to build better surgical probes.</s>
 <s id="32">Only research done out of sheer curiosity, with no application in mind, could have given us the discovery of the electron and X-rays.</s>
 <s id="33">Now, this tube also threw open the gates for our understanding of the universe and the field of particle physics, because it's also the first, very simple particle accelerator.</s>
 <s id="34">Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators, and I try and understand how beams behave.</s>
 <s id="35">And my field's a bit unusual, because it crosses between curiosity-driven research and technology with real-world applications.</s>
 <s id="36">But it's the combination of those two things that gets me really excited about what I do.</s>
 <s id="37">Now, over the last 100 years, there have been far too many examples for me to list them all.</s>
 <s id="38">But I want to share with you just a few.</s>
 <s id="39">In 1928, a physicist named Paul Dirac found something strange in his equations.</s>
 <s id="40">And he predicted, based purely on mathematical insight, that there ought to be a second kind of matter, the opposite to normal matter, that literally annihilates when it comes in contact: antimatter.</s>
 <s id="41">I mean, the idea sounded ridiculous.</s>
 <s id="42">But within four years, they'd found it.</s>
 <s id="43">And nowadays, we use it every day in hospitals, in positron emission tomography, or PET scans, used for detecting disease.</s>
 <s id="44">Or, take these X-rays.</s>
 <s id="45">If you can get these electrons up to a higher energy, so about 1,000 times higher than this tube, the X-rays that those produce can actually deliver enough ionizing radiation to kill human cells.</s>
 <s id="46">And if you can shape and direct those X-rays where you want them to go, that allows us to do an incredible thing: to treat cancer without drugs or surgery, which we call radiotherapy.</s>
 <s id="47">In countries like Australia and the UK, around half of all cancer patients are treated using radiotherapy.</s>
 <s id="48">And so, electron accelerators are actually standard equipment in most hospitals.</s>
 <s id="49">Or, a little closer to home: if you have a smartphone or a computer -- and this is TEDx, so you've got both with you right now, right?</s>
 <s id="50">Well, inside those devices are chips that are made by implanting single ions into silicon, in a process called ion implantation.</s>
 <s id="51">And that uses a particle accelerator.</s>
 <s id="52">Without curiosity-driven research, though, none of these things would exist at all.</s>
 <s id="53">So, over the years, we really learned to explore inside the atom.</s>
 <s id="54">And to do that, we had to learn to develop particle accelerators.</s>
 <s id="55">The first ones we developed let us split the atom.</s>
 <s id="56">And then we got to higher and higher energies; we created circular accelerators that let us delve into the nucleus and then create new elements, even.</s>
 <s id="57">And at that point, we were no longer just exploring inside the atom.</s>
 <s id="58">We'd actually learned how to control these particles.</s>
 <s id="59">We'd learned how to interact with our world on a scale that's too small for humans to see or touch or even sense that it's there.</s>
 <s id="60">And then we built larger and larger accelerators, because we were curious about the nature of the universe.</s>
 <s id="61">As we went deeper and deeper, new particles started popping up.</s>
 <s id="62">Eventually, we got to huge ring-like machines that take two beams of particles in opposite directions, squeeze them down to less than the width of a hair and smash them together.</s>
 <s id="63">And then, using Einstein's E=mc2, you can take all of that energy and convert it into new matter, new particles which we rip from the very fabric of the universe.</s>
 <s id="64">Nowadays, there are about 35,000 accelerators in the world, not including televisions.</s>
 <s id="65">And inside each one of these incredible machines, there are hundreds of billions of tiny particles, dancing and swirling in systems that are more complex than the formation of galaxies.</s>
 <s id="66">You guys, I can't even begin to explain how incredible it is that we can do this.</s>
 <s id="67">(Laughter) (Applause) So I want to encourage you to invest your time and energy in people that do curiosity-driven research.</s>
 <s id="68">It was Jonathan Swift who once said, "Vision is the art of seeing the invisible."</s>
 <s id="69">And over a century ago, J.J. Thompson did just that, when he pulled back the veil on the subatomic world.</s>
 <s id="70">And now we need to invest in curiosity-driven research, because we have so many challenges that we face.</s>
 <s id="71">And we need patience; we need to give scientists the time, the space and the means to continue their quest, because history tells us that if we can remain curious and open-minded about the outcomes of research, the more world-changing our discoveries will be.</s>
 <s id="72">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="73">(Applause)</s>
