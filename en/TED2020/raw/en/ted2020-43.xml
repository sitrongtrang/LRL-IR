  <s id="1.1">Hello.</s>
  <s id="1.2">Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country -- and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.</s>
 <s id="3">And how do you bring those two things together?</s>
 <s id="4">Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers, to bring people into the process of creating things.</s>
 <s id="5">And that's what I want to talk about today.</s>
 <s id="6">So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big, I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in, and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo.</s>
 <s id="7">I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them.</s>
  <s id="8.2">And I think, a lot of times, what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go, "Duh!</s>
  <s id="8.3">You know, look what's really going on."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">And rather than talk about it in the theory, I think I'm just going to show you an example.</s>
 <s id="10">We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was.</s>
 <s id="11">And I think they were expecting -- they'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other, and all kinds of mappy stuff.</s>
 <s id="12">Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.</s>
 <s id="13">The first thing we actually shared with them was this.</s>
 <s id="14">I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.</s>
 <s id="15">This is 59 seconds into the film.</s>
 <s id="16">This is a minute 59.</s>
 <s id="17">3:19.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">I think something happens.</s>
  <s id="18.2">I think a head may appear in a second.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">5:10.</s>
 <s id="20">5:58.</s>
 <s id="21">6:20.</s>
 <s id="22">We showed them the whole cut, and they were all completely, what is this?</s>
 <s id="23">And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day, all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.</s>
 <s id="24">And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.</s>
 <s id="25">He just lay in the hospital bed, and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time.</s>
 <s id="26">That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.</s>
 <s id="27">And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">Oh, my goodness.</s>
  <s id="28.2">So, looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was, for these guys, quite a revelation.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.</s>
 <s id="30">So they snapped into action.</s>
 <s id="31">They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.</s>
 <s id="32">It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.</s>
 <s id="33">It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.</s>
 <s id="34">So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.</s>
 <s id="35">The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.</s>
 <s id="36">You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror, so it created a tiny human interaction.</s>
 <s id="37">Very small example of something that they could do.</s>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action -- said, OK, we embrace this.</s>
  <s id="38.2">What can we do?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.</s>
 <s id="40">Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.</s>
 <s id="41">I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.</s>
 <s id="42">It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.</s>
 <s id="43">Not particularly the world's best design solution for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers, but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.</s>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, "This is my room.</s>
  <s id="44.2">This is my personal space" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">So you went from public space to private space.</s>
 <s id="46">And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.</s>
 <s id="47">So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room, which was lovely.</s>
 <s id="48">So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.</s>
 <s id="49">I thought that was a really, really nice example.</s>
 <s id="50">So this is not particularly a new idea, kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution.</s>
 <s id="51">It's a history of invention based around this.</s>
 <s id="52">I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.</s>
 <s id="53">Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning, saw her daughter watching the test card, waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street.</s>
 <s id="54">Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship.</s>
 <s id="55">And he invented the shipping container.</s>
 <s id="56">George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs, sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.</s>
 <s id="57">And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road, when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.</s>
 <s id="58">So there's a whole series of just using your eyes, seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.</s>
 <s id="59">Second one, without sounding overly Zen, and this is a quote from the Buddha: "Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things, is often a really interesting place to start."</s>
 <s id="60">Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.</s>
 <s id="61">So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision, is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.</s>
 <s id="62">Again, another medical example here.</s>
 <s id="63">We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.</s>
 <s id="64">We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics.</s>
 <s id="65">This was a device that a nurse uses when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.</s>
 <s id="66">They'll ask the nurses to input data.</s>
 <s id="67">And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.</s>
 <s id="68">When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren't recognizing.</s>
 <s id="69">When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device's data was about; it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did, was hold the patient's hand to comfort them.</s>
  <s id="70.2">Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="71">So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy but much more human and practical, was this.</s>
 <s id="72">So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.</s>
 <s id="73">So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product.</s>
 <s id="74">And I think that's really, really important.</s>
 <s id="75">So, again, this idea of workarounds.</s>
 <p id="p76">
  <s id="76.1">We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us.</s>
  <s id="76.2">I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="77">This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.</s>
 <s id="78">We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"</s>
 <s id="79">It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.</s>
 <s id="80">Why do we all follow the line in the street?</s>
 <s id="81">This is a picture in a Japanese subway.</s>
 <s id="82">People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.</s>
 <s id="83">Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?</s>
 <s id="84">Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.</s>
 <s id="85">We don't know why, but we do.</s>
 <s id="86">Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?</s>
 <s id="87">Again, we're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions.</s>
 <s id="88">And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.</s>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">This stuff is really important.</s>
  <s id="89.2">This stuff is really vital."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="90">This is people designing their own experiences.</s>
 <s id="91">You can draw from this.</s>
 <s id="92">We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.</s>
 <s id="93">It's there for our use, on some level.</s>
 <s id="94">So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.</s>
 <s id="95">We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.</s>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">And this is my favorite one.</s>
  <s id="96.2">My mother used to say to me, "Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p97">
  <s id="97.1">But, of course, we all do.</s>
  <s id="97.2">We all follow each other every day.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="98">So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something, that's permission for them to do the same thing.</s>
 <s id="99">And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.</s>
 <s id="100">I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."</s>
 <s id="101">And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.</s>
 <s id="102">We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we're doing.</s>
 <s id="103">Third section is this idea of not knowing, of consciously putting yourself backwards.</s>
 <s id="104">I talk about unthinking situations all the time.</s>
 <s id="105">Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.</s>
 <s id="106">A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.</s>
 <s id="107">This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.</s>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">Hammer it together.</s>
  <s id="108.2">Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">But big selling bookcase.</s>
  <s id="109.2">How do we replicate this for children?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">The reality is when you actually watch children, children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.</s>
 <s id="111">Children assume permission in a very different way.</s>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">Children live on things.</s>
  <s id="112.2">They live under things.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">They live around things, and so their spatial awareness relationship, and their thinking around storage is totally different.</s>
 <p id="p114">
  <s id="114.1">So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer -- is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes.</s>
  <s id="114.2">And so, here he is sitting under the table.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="115">So, what came out of this?</s>
 <s id="116">This is the storage system that he designed.</s>
 <p id="p117">
  <s id="117.1">So what is this?</s>
  <s id="117.2">I hear you all ask.</s>
  <s id="117.3">No, I don't.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="118">(Laughter) It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.</s>
 <s id="119">So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.</s>
 <s id="120">It's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.</s>
 <s id="121">(Laughter) But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary, and I think that's one of the things.</s>
 <s id="122">And putting yourself in the position of the person, and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?</s>
 <s id="123">And then use that information to fuel solutions?</s>
 <s id="124">And I think that's what this is very much about.</s>
 <p id="p125">
  <s id="125.1">Last section: green armband.</s>
  <s id="125.2">We've all got them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="126">It's about this really.</s>
 <s id="127">I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win.</s>
 <p id="p128">
  <s id="128.1">Again, that's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is: Where do we start?</s>
  <s id="128.2">How do we start?</s>
  <s id="128.3">What do we do to start?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="129">So, again, we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.</s>
 <s id="130">They're now called KickStart.</s>
 <s id="131">And, again, as designers, we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.</s>
 <s id="132">And that was completely irrelevant.</s>
 <p id="p133">
  <s id="133.1">When you put yourself in the position of these people, things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant than the form of it.</s>
  <s id="133.2">The way it's produced, it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="134">So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.</s>
 <s id="135">We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.</s>
 <s id="136">So what seems like a very clunky product is, in fact, incredibly useful.</s>
 <s id="137">It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.</s>
 <p id="p138">
  <s id="138.1">Children can use it.</s>
  <s id="138.2">Adults can use it.</s>
  <s id="138.3">Everybody uses it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="139">It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.</s>
 <s id="140">These guys are using this very successfully.</s>
 <s id="141">And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.</s>
 <s id="142">So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.</s>
 <s id="143">There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.</s>
 <s id="144">So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning.</s>
 <s id="145">We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.</s>
 <s id="146">Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.</s>
 <s id="147">We feel that this is an important gesture.</s>
 <p id="p148">
  <s id="148.1">So we've handed out bracelets.</s>
  <s id="148.2">Small is the new big.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="149">I hope you'll all wear them.</s>
 <p id="p150">
  <s id="150.1">So that's it.</s>
  <s id="150.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="151">(Applause)</s>
