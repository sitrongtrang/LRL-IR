 <s id="1">“It was a pleasure to burn.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed.”</s>
  <s id="2.2">Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze - and before long, we learn what’s going up in flames.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">Ray Bradbury’s novel imagines a world where books are banned from all areas of life - and possessing, let alone reading them, is forbidden.</s>
 <s id="4">The protagonist, Montag, is a fireman responsible for destroying what remains.</s>
 <s id="5">But as his pleasure gives way to doubt, the story raises critical questions of how to preserve one’s mind in a society where free will, self-expression, and curiosity are under fire.</s>
 <s id="6">In Montag’s world, mass media has a monopoly on information, erasing almost all ability for independent thought.</s>
 <s id="7">On the subway, ads blast out of the walls.</s>
 <s id="8">At home, Montag’s wife Mildred listens to the radio around the clock, and three of their parlor walls are plastered with screens.</s>
 <s id="9">At work, the smell of kerosene hangs over Montag’s colleagues, who smoke and set their mechanical hound after rats to pass the time.</s>
 <s id="10">When the alarm sounds they surge out in salamander-shaped vehicles, sometimes to burn whole libraries to the ground.</s>
 <s id="11">But as he sets tomes ablaze day after day like “black butterflies,” Montag’s mind occasionally wanders to the contraband that lies hidden in his home.</s>
 <s id="12">Gradually, he begins to question the basis of his work.</s>
 <s id="13">Montag realizes he’s always felt uneasy - but has lacked the descriptive words to express his feelings in a society where even uttering the phrase “once upon a time” can be fatal.</s>
 <s id="14">Fahrenheit 451 depicts a world governed by surveillance, robotics, and virtual reality- a vision that proved remarkably prescient, but also spoke to the concerns of the time.</s>
 <s id="15">The novel was published in 1953, at the height of the Cold War.</s>
 <s id="16">This era kindled widespread paranoia and fear throughout Bradbury’s home country of the United States, amplified by the suppression of information and brutal government investigations.</s>
 <s id="17">In particular, this witch hunt mentality targeted artists and writers who were suspected of Communist sympathies.</s>
 <s id="18">Bradbury was alarmed at this cultural crackdown.</s>
 <s id="19">He believed it set a dangerous precedent for further censorship, and was reminded of the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and the book-burning of Fascist regimes.</s>
 <s id="20">He explored these chilling connections in Fahrenheit 451, titled after the temperature at which paper burns.</s>
 <s id="21">The accuracy of that temperature has been called into question, but that doesn’t diminish the novel’s standing as a masterpiece of dystopian fiction.</s>
 <s id="22">Dystopian fiction as a genre amplifies troubling features of the world around us and imagines the consequences of taking them to an extreme.</s>
 <s id="23">In many dystopian stories, the government imposes constrictions onto unwilling subjects.</s>
 <s id="24">But in Fahrenheit 451, Montag learns that it was the apathy of the masses that gave rise to the current regime.</s>
 <s id="25">The government merely capitalized on short attention spans and the appetite for mindless entertainment, reducing the circulation of ideas to ash.</s>
 <s id="26">As culture disappears, imagination and self-expression follow.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">Even the way people talk is short-circuited - such as when Montag’s boss Captain Beatty describes the acceleration of mass culture: "Speed up the film, Montag, quick.</s>
  <s id="27.2">Click?</s>
  <s id="27.3">Pic?</s>
  <s id="27.4">Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh?</s>
  <s id="27.5">Uh!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">Bang!</s>
  <s id="28.2">Smack!</s>
  <s id="28.3">Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom!</s>
  <s id="28.4">Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests.</s>

 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">Politics?</s>
  <s id="29.2">One column, two sentences, a headline!</s>
  <s id="29.3">Then, in mid-air, all vanishes!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">In this barren world, Montag learns how difficult it is to resist when there's nothing left to hold on to.</s>
 <s id="31">Altogether, Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of independent thought on the brink of extinction - and a parable about a society which is complicit in its own combustion.</s>
