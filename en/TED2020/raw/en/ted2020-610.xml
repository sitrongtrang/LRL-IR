 <s id="1">There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there."</s>
 <s id="2">My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.</s>
 <s id="3">What I wanted to do is to show the world that the little things can be the biggest things.</s>
 <s id="4">We all seem to think that, you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.</s>
 <s id="5">And we use the word "nothing."</s>
 <s id="6">Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.</s>
 <s id="7">My mother told me that, when I was a child, that I should always respect the little things.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">What made me do this work?</s>
  <s id="8.2">I shall go into my story.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">This all started when I was age five.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">What made me do it?</s>
  <s id="10.2">At school, I will admit this: academically, I couldn't express myself.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."</s>
 <s id="12">My world was seen as less.</s>
 <s id="13">So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.</s>
 <s id="14">I thought, I need to retreat into something else.</s>
 <s id="15">So when my mother used to take me to school, she thought I was at school, and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned, and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.</s>
 <s id="16">Now, the one time I was in the shed, and my mother suspected something, thinking I was at school.</s>
 <s id="17">My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.</s>
 <s id="18">So you'd just see her feet.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) So I was hiding in the shed, like that.</s>
 <s id="20">And all of a sudden ...</s>
 <s id="21">And then I saw her legs.</s>
 <s id="22">And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big -- and she lifted me up and she says, "How come you're not at school?"</s>
 <s id="23">I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me, and using me as an example of failure.</s>
 <s id="24">So I told her.</s>
 <s id="25">At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way, but I told her I didn't feel right.</s>
 <s id="26">And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">And walked off.</s>
  <s id="27.2">And I didn't expect that, because I expected one of these ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">But I didn't get it.</s>
 <s id="29">So I'm sitting there thinking.</s>
 <s id="30">And as I looked down on the ground, I noticed there was some ants running around.</s>
 <s id="31">And I went into this little fantasy world.</s>
 <s id="32">And I thought, "These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?</s>
 <s id="33">Or do they need somewhere to live?"</s>
 <s id="34">So I thought "Perhaps, if I made these ants some apartments, they'll move in."</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) So I did.</s>
 <s id="36">And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.</s>
 <s id="37">And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass, constructed this little apartment.</s>
 <s id="38">Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.</s>
 <s id="39">But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.</s>
 <s id="40">And so they did.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">That was a bit crude, at the time.</s>
  <s id="41.2">And I made all these little apartments and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.</s>
 <s id="43">And then I sat down and all the ants came along.</s>
 <s id="44">And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"</s>
 <s id="45">(Laughter) And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."</s>
 <s id="46">And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.</s>
 <s id="47">(Laughter) And from there I was watching this little world.</s>
 <s id="48">It became part of me.</s>
 <s id="49">When I discovered that I had this gift, I wanted to experiment with this world that we can't see.</s>
 <s id="50">So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that's huge.</s>
 <s id="51">So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.</s>
 <p id="p52">
  <s id="52.1">And as I got older, I continued.</s>
  <s id="52.2">I showed my mother.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="53">My mother told me to take it smaller.</s>
 <s id="54">Now I shall show you something here.</s>
 <s id="55">And I'll explain.</s>
 <s id="56">As you can see, that's a pinhead.</s>
 <s id="57">(Laughter) (Applause) Now that is called the Huf Haus.</s>
 <s id="58">The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Huf.</s>
 <s id="59">And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"</s>
 <s id="60">(Laughter) So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">(Laughter) And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it.</s>
  <s id="61.2">Can you really do it?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">And I says, "Well, try me."</s>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this."</s>
  <s id="63.2">So I said, "OK."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="64">So, to cut a long story short, I went home, went underneath the microscope, and I crushed up a piece of glass, crushed it up.</s>
 <s id="65">And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass.</s>
 <s id="66">Some of them were quite jagged.</s>
 <s id="67">So I was crushing up these pieces of glass, which, as you can see, that's the actual frame of the house.</s>
 <s id="68">And the actual roof is made up of a fiber, which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.</s>
 <s id="69">(Laughter) So I got the teddy bear and I said, "Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"</s>
 <s id="70">So I did.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">And I looked at it beneath the microscope.</s>
  <s id="71.2">And some of it was flat.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">So I decided to slice these up with the tool that I make by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.</s>
 <s id="73">And then I actually slow down my whole nervous system.</s>
 <s id="74">And then I work between my heartbeat, I have one-and-a-half seconds to actually move.</s>
 <s id="75">And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work, at the same time.</s>
 <s id="76">(Laughter) (Applause) Because that has happened to me.</s>
 <s id="77">(Laughter) So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.</s>
 <s id="78">I found these little bits of glass.</s>
 <s id="79">And I had to make them square.</s>
 <s id="80">So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"</s>
 <p id="p81">
  <s id="81.1">So what I did, I got an oilstone.</s>
  <s id="81.2">Broke the edge of an oilstone off.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p82">
  <s id="82.1">And what I did, I took pieces of glass.</s>
  <s id="82.2">And I started to rub them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="83">I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.</s>
 <s id="84">And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">And then I started rubbing, very very gently, till some of the edges were quite square.</s>
  <s id="85.2">And then I constructed it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">And how I constructed it, is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.</s>
 <s id="87">And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.</s>
 <s id="88">And as I was doing it, what happened?</s>
 <s id="89">The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.</s>
 <s id="90">And it went like this ...</s>
 <s id="91">And then that was it.</s>
 <s id="92">(Laughter) Gone.</s>
 <s id="93">So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another, into the atmosphere somewhere."</s>
 <s id="94">So to cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it.</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">So I found some more.</s>
  <s id="95.2">And I decided to, sort of, construct it very, very slowly, holding my breath, working between my heartbeat, and making sure everything is leveled.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="96">Because it's such a small sculpture, nothing can go wrong.</s>
 <s id="97">And I decided to build it up.</s>
 <s id="98">Then I used fibers out of my jumper, which I held and stretched.</s>
 <s id="99">And made the beams going around the house.</s>
 <s id="100">And the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.</s>
 <s id="101">I used a money spider's web to actually attach certain things, which sent me insane.</s>
 <s id="102">But I managed to do it.</s>
 <s id="103">And when I finished it, I came back the next day.</s>
 <s id="104">I noticed that the house was occupied.</s>
 <s id="105">Have we ever heard of a dust mite?</s>
 <s id="106">Darren dust mite and his family moved in.</s>
 <s id="107">(Laughter) So basically I'd completed the house.</s>
 <s id="108">And there you are.</s>
 <p id="p109">
  <s id="109.1">(Applause) (Laughter) Right.</s>
  <s id="109.2">As you can see, Bart Simpson is having a little argument.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="110">I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.</s>
 <s id="111">There's not enough room for the two of them.</s>
 <s id="112">So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.</s>
 <s id="113">I think he was just warning him actually.</s>
 <s id="114">But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.</s>
 <s id="115">What I did, I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope.</s>
 <s id="116">I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.</s>
 <s id="117">Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?</s>
 <s id="118">Audience: No.</s>
 <s id="119">WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very, very slowly, manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.</s>
 <s id="120">Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.</s>
 <s id="121">Because it's on this molecular level things change and they act different.</s>
 <s id="122">And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.</s>
 <s id="123">And, you know, all different things happen.</s>
 <s id="124">But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane, to stop it moving.</s>
 <s id="125">Then static electricity set in.</s>
 <s id="126">And it went ...</s>
 <p id="p127">
  <s id="127.1">And I'm trying to remove it.</s>
  <s id="127.2">And the static is interfering with everything.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="128">So there is sweat dripping off my head, because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.</s>
 <s id="129">And after I've cut out the shape, then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.</s>
 <s id="130">So after I've done the same thing, then I have to paint it.</s>
 <s id="131">And after I've actually sculpted them, I have to paint them.</s>
 <s id="132">I experimented with a -- I found a dead fly.</s>
 <s id="133">And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.</s>
 <s id="134">Decided to make a paintbrush.</s>
 <s id="135">(Laughter) But I would never do it to a living fly.</s>
 <s id="136">(Laughter) Because I've heard a fly in pain.</s>
 <p id="p137">
  <s id="137.1">And they go "Meow!</s>
  <s id="137.2">Ow!"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="138">Even though they get on our nerves, I would never kill an insect because, "All creatures great and small" -- there is a hymn that says that.</s>
 <s id="139">So what I decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face.</s>
 <s id="140">And I looked at it underneath the microscope.</s>
 <s id="141">That was the paintbrush.</s>
 <s id="142">And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.</s>
 <s id="143">And it starts to dry very quickly.</s>
 <s id="144">So I have to be very quick.</s>
 <s id="145">If I'm not, it will end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like.</s>
 <s id="146">It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.</s>
 <s id="147">So I have to be very very careful.</s>
 <s id="148">This one took me approximately, I would say, six to seven weeks.</s>
 <s id="149">My work, rough estimate, sometimes five, six to seven weeks; you can't always anticipate.</s>
 <s id="150">(Applause) As you can see, that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.</s>
 <s id="151">(Laughter) He says to me, "Willard" -- You can see him saying, "Why me?"</s>
 <p id="p152">
  <s id="152.1">I says, "I enjoyed your film.</s>
  <s id="152.2">That's why."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="153">As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.</s>
 <s id="154">That's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture.</s>
 <s id="155">I would say it probably measures ...</s>
 <s id="156">a quarter of a millimeter.</s>
 <s id="157">In America they say a period stop.</s>
 <s id="158">So say if you cut a period stop in half, a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.</s>
 <s id="159">It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.</s>
 <s id="160">And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber, which I took out of the air.</s>
 <s id="161">When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.</s>
 <p id="p162">
  <s id="162.1">And what I normally do is walk 'round a room -- (Laughter) -- trying to find one.</s>
  <s id="162.2">And then I put it underneath the microscope.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="163">I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.</s>
 <s id="164">And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.</s>
 <s id="165">And she saw me walking around like this.</s>
 <s id="166">(Laughter) And then she looked at me.</s>
 <s id="167">And then I went ...</s>
 <s id="168">And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."</s>
 <s id="169">Yeah, to actually do this thing -- the actual chariot is made of gold.</s>
 <s id="170">I had a 24-karat gold ring.</s>
 <s id="171">And I cut off a little flake of gold.</s>
 <s id="172">And I bent it 'round, and made it into the chariot.</s>
 <s id="173">And the horse is made from nylon.</s>
 <s id="174">And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.</s>
 <s id="175">To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult, because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action.</s>
 <s id="176">When I did this one, a gentleman seen it and said to me, "There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.</s>
 <s id="177">There's no way a man can do that.</s>
 <s id="178">It must be a machine."</s>
 <s id="179">So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."</s>
 <s id="180">(Laughter) (Applause) That one took me approximately six weeks.</s>
 <s id="181">(Applause) The most famous statue in the world.</s>
 <s id="182">This one, I would say, was a serious challenge.</s>
 <s id="183">(Laughter) Because I had to put the torch on the top.</s>
 <s id="184">That one is, more or less, the same type of process.</s>
 <s id="185">The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand, because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.</s>
 <s id="186">I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base.</s>
 <s id="187">Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this, because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of, you know, the beginning of people coming to America.</s>
 <s id="188">So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.</s>
 <s id="189">And that's the first thing they saw.</s>
 <s id="190">So I wanted to have that little image.</s>
 <s id="191">And this is it.</s>
 <s id="192">(Laughter) And we all know that is the Hulk.</s>
 <s id="193">I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.</s>
 <s id="194">Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it.</s>
 <s id="195">So I broke the needle.</s>
 <s id="196">And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it.</s>
 <s id="197">It's -- I had to make little holes in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.</s>
 <s id="198">So most of my work, I don't use glue.</s>
 <s id="199">They go in with their own friction.</s>
 <s id="200">And that's how I managed to do it.</s>
 <p id="p201">
  <s id="201.1">As you can see, he's looking at the moment.</s>
  <s id="201.2">He's got a little grimace on his face.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="202">And his mouth must be probably about three microns.</s>
 <s id="203">So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.</s>
 <s id="204">That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.</s>
 <s id="205">And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.</s>
 <s id="206">But I had to rig it with strands of glue.</s>
 <s id="207">Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane, because I couldn't get the web to move off.</s>
 <p id="p208">
  <s id="208.1">And that's 24-karat gold.</s>
  <s id="208.2">And it's constructed.</s>
  <s id="208.3">I built it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="209">Constructed each plank of gold.</s>
 <s id="210">And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.</s>
 <s id="211">The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.</s>
 <s id="212">It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.</s>
 <s id="213">(Applause) As you can see, dressage.</s>
 <s id="214">(Laughter) It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.</s>
 <s id="215">The actual rigging on the reins on the horse are made from the same sort of thing.</s>
 <s id="216">And that was done with a particle from my shirt.</s>
 <s id="217">And the pinhead I've made green around there by scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle.</s>
 <s id="218">It's very painstaking work, but the best things come in small packages.</s>
 <s id="219">(Laughter) Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan!</s>
 <s id="220">(Applause)</s>
