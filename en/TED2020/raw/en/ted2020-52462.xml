 <s id="1">In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses.</s>
 <s id="2">He wanted a solution for blurry vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on external aids.</s>
 <s id="3">But the surgery he eventually devised was not for the faint of heart.</s>
 <s id="4">Barraquer began by slicing off the front of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid nitrogen.</s>
 <s id="5">Using a miniature lathe, he ground the frozen cornea into the precise shape necessary to focus the patient’s vision.</s>
 <s id="6">Then he thawed the disc, and sewed it back on.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Barraquer called this procedure keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” and “cornea.”</s>
  <s id="7.2">And though it might sound grisly, his technique produced reliable results.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">So how did Barraquer’s surgery work?</s>
 <s id="9">Keratomileusis corrects what are called refractive errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses incoming light.</s>
 <s id="10">Ideally, the cornea and lens work together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of refractive errors can impair this delicate system.</s>
 <s id="11">In people with myopia, or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short of the retina.</s>
 <s id="12">Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, have the opposite problem: light is focused too far beyond the retina.</s>
 <s id="13">And in people with astigmatism, the cornea has two different curvatures which focus light at two distances and produce blurry vision.</s>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">Even those with perfect vision will eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.”</s>
  <s id="14.2">As the proteins in the lens age, they slowly increase its size.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too large to easily change shape and shift focus.</s>
 <s id="16">Glasses and contact lenses bend light to compensate for these refractive errors.</s>
 <s id="17">But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can also alter the shape of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, forwards, or pulling a divided image together.</s>
 <s id="18">And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can sculpt the cornea with far less invasive tools.</s>
 <s id="19">In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons rely on excimer lasers.</s>
 <s id="20">These tools are accurate enough to etch words into a human hair.</s>
 <s id="21">To safely accomplish these ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation.</s>
 <s id="22">This allows the laser to essentially evaporate organic tissue without overheating surrounding eye tissue.</s>
 <s id="23">So how does laser eye surgery actually work?</s>
 <s id="24">The first step is to separate a thin layer from the front of the cornea.</s>
 <s id="25">This can be done with either a flat, wide blade, or a femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma bubbles to create a plane beneath the corneal surface.</s>
 <s id="26">Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the inside of the cornea.</s>
 <s id="27">Guided by the refractive error and the shape of the cornea, the excimer laser robotically sculpts the exposed corneal bed into the correct shape.</s>
 <s id="28">This process usually takes less than 30 seconds for each eye.</s>
 <s id="29">Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges reseal themselves in just a few hours.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">Because the lasering is done on the eyeball itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.”</s>
  <s id="30.2">Its complete name is “laser in-situ keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">Essentially, this technique carves a patient’s contact lens prescription onto their cornea.</s>
 <s id="32">Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks.</s>
 <s id="33">Some patients experience slightly blurred vision that can’t be corrected by glasses.</s>
 <s id="34">But the technique is currently about as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact lenses for one year.</s>
 <s id="35">Today, a technique called SMILE enables surgeons to sculpt the cornea through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time.</s>
 <s id="36">And lasers aren’t just correcting the three types of refractive errors – this technology can also restore aging eyes.</s>
 <s id="37">In a technique called Laser Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly better at distance vision and the other to be better at close range vision.</s>
 <s id="38">The difference between the two eyes is small enough that most patients can merge their vision, allowing both eyes to work together at all distances.</s>
 <s id="39">Advances in laser technology continue to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible.</s>
 <s id="40">One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a world without glasses may finally come true.</s>
