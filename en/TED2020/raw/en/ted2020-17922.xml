 <s id="1">We're at a critical moment.</s>
 <s id="2">Our leaders, some of our great institutions are failing us.</s>
 <s id="3">Why?</s>
 <s id="4">In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, but often, they've taken us to the wrong objectives.</s>
 <s id="5">And this is unacceptable.</s>
 <s id="6">This has to stop.</s>
 <s id="7">How are we going to correct these wrongs?</s>
 <s id="8">How are we going to choose the right course?</s>
 <s id="9">It's not going to be easy.</s>
 <s id="10">For years, I've worked with talented teams and they've chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives.</s>
 <s id="11">Many have succeeded, others of them have failed.</s>
 <s id="12">And today I'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that's what's crucial, how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons.</s>
 <s id="13">Let's go back to 1975.</s>
 <s id="14">Yep, this is me.</s>
 <s id="15">I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.</s>
 <s id="16">Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.</s>
 <s id="17">Execution is what matters the most."</s>
 <s id="18">And so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and Key Results."</s>
 <s id="19">It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?</s>
 <s id="20">And it's all about excellent execution.</s>
 <s id="21">So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove.</s>
 <s id="22">(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases of the management by objective systems are the objectives and the key results, and they match the two purposes.</s>
 <s id="23">The objective is the direction.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">The key results have to be measured, but at the end you can look and without any argument say, "Did I do that, or did I not do that?"</s>
  <s id="24.2">Yes.</s>
  <s id="24.3">No.</s>
  <s id="24.4">Simple.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">John Doerr: That's Andy.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">Yes.</s>
  <s id="26.2">No.</s>
  <s id="26.3">Simple.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations, they work for teams, they even work for individuals.</s>
 <s id="28">The objectives are what you want to have accomplished.</s>
 <s id="29">The key results are how I'm going to get that done.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">Objectives.</s>
  <s id="30.2">Key results.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">What and how.</s>
 <s id="32">But here's the truth: many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us are not setting goals at all.</s>
 <s id="33">A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them.</s>
 <s id="34">They ship their sales, they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams.</s>
 <s id="35">So how do you set these goals the right way?</s>
 <s id="36">First, you must answer the question, "Why?"</s>
 <s id="37">Why?</s>
 <s id="38">Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why.</s>
 <s id="39">I want to tell you a story.</s>
 <s id="40">I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.</s>
 <s id="41">Her name is Jini Kim.</s>
 <s id="42">She runs a company called Nuna.</s>
 <s id="43">Nuna is a health care data company.</s>
 <s id="44">And when Nuna was founded, they used data to serve the health needs of lots of workers at large companies.</s>
 <s id="45">And then two years into the company's life, the federal government issued a proposal to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="46">Now, you'll remember that Medicaid is that program that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children and people with disabilities.</s>
 <s id="47">Nuna at the time was just 15 people and this database had to be built in one year, and they had a whole set of commitments that they had to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money on the project.</s>
 <s id="48">This was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">She jumped at the opportunity.</s>
  <s id="49.2">She did not flinch.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">Why?</s>
 <s id="51">Well, it's a personal why.</s>
 <s id="52">Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.</s>
 <s id="53">And when he was seven, he had his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland.</s>
 <p id="p54">
  <s id="54.1">He fell to the ground.</s>
  <s id="54.2">He stopped breathing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="55">Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.</s>
 <s id="56">They came to the country with limited resources speaking little English, so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="57">She was nine years old.</s>
 <s id="58">That moment defined her mission, and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract.</s>
 <s id="59">Here's Jini to tell you why.</s>
 <s id="60">(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy, and today it provides for Kimong's health and for millions of others.</s>
 <s id="61">Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="62">Every row of data is a life whose story deserves to be told with dignity.</s>
 <s id="63">JD: And Jini's story tells us that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives.</s>
 <s id="64">Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished.</s>
 <s id="65">And objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, and they're a kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking.</s>
 <s id="66">You think a rockstar would be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key Results, but for years, Bono has used OKRs to wage a global war against poverty and disease, and his ONE organization has focused on two really gorgeous, audacious objectives.</s>
 <s id="67">The first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the world.</s>
 <s id="68">The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs.</s>
 <s id="69">Now, why are these good objectives?</s>
 <s id="70">Let's go back to our checklist.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">Significant?</s>
  <s id="71.2">Check.</s>
  <s id="71.3">Concrete?</s>
  <s id="71.4">Yes.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">Action-oriented?</s>
  <s id="72.2">Yes.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">Inspirational?</s>
 <s id="74">Well, let's just listen to Bono.</s>
 <s id="75">(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?</s>
 <s id="76">How passionate?</s>
 <s id="77">What actions does your passion lead you to do?</s>
 <s id="78">If the heart doesn't find a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means nothing.</s>
 <s id="79">The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it.</s>
 <s id="80">It gives us an environment for risk, for trust, where failing is not a fireable offense.</s>
 <s id="81">And when you have that sort of structure and environment and the right people, magic is around the corner.</s>
 <s id="82">JD: I love that.</s>
 <s id="83">OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner.</s>
 <s id="84">This is perfect.</s>
 <s id="85">So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats of goal-setting.</s>
 <s id="86">Let's turn our attention to the hows.</s>
 <s id="87">Remember, the hows are the key results.</s>
 <s id="88">That's how we meet our objectives.</s>
 <s id="89">And good results are specific and time-bound.</s>
 <s id="90">They're aggressive but realistic.</s>
 <s id="91">They're measurable, and they're verifiable.</s>
 <s id="92">Those are good key results.</s>
 <s id="93">In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey.</s>
 <s id="94">Here they are, 24 years old in their garage.</s>
 <s id="95">And Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them.</s>
 <s id="96">Well, not quite.</s>
 <s id="97">What he really said was, "We don't have any other way to manage this company, so we'll give it a go."</s>
 <s id="98">(Laughter) And I took that as a kind of endorsement.</s>
 <s id="99">But every quarter since then, every Googler has written down her objectives and her key results.</s>
 <s id="100">They've graded them, and they've published them for everyone to see.</s>
 <s id="101">And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions.</s>
 <s id="102">They're set aside.</s>
 <s id="103">They're used for a higher purpose, and that's to get collective commitment to truly stretch goals.</s>
 <s id="104">In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective which was to build the next generation client platform for the future of web applications -- in other words, build the best browser.</s>
 <s id="105">He was very thoughtful about how he chose his key results.</s>
 <s id="106">How do you measure the best browser?</s>
 <s id="107">It could be ad clicks or engagement.</s>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">No.</s>
  <s id="108.2">He said: numbers of users, because users are going to decide if Chrome is a great browser or not.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="109">So he had this one three-year-long objective: build the best browser.</s>
 <s id="110">And then every year he stuck to the same key results, numbers of users, but he upped the ante.</s>
 <s id="111">In the first year, his goal was 20 million users and he missed it.</s>
 <s id="112">He got less than 10.</s>
 <s id="113">Second year, he raised the bar to 50 million.</s>
 <s id="114">He got to 37 million users.</s>
 <s id="115">Somewhat better.</s>
 <s id="116">In the third year, he upped the ante once more to a hundred million.</s>
 <s id="117">He launched an aggressive marketing campaign, broader distribution, improved the technology, and kaboom!</s>
 <s id="118">He got 111 million users.</s>
 <s id="119">Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, but it shows someone carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it year after year after year.</s>
 <s id="120">It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.</s>
 <s id="121">Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels that are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions.</s>
 <s id="122">What really matters is the why that we pour into those vessels.</s>
 <s id="123">That's why we do our work.</s>
 <s id="124">OKRs are not a silver bullet.</s>
 <s id="125">They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture or for stronger leadership, but when those fundamentals are in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.</s>
 <s id="126">I want you to think about your life for a moment.</s>
 <s id="127">Do you have the right metrics?</s>
 <s id="128">Take time to write down your values, your objectives and your key results.</s>
 <s id="129">Do it today.</s>
 <s id="130">If you'd like some feedback on them, you can send them to me.</s>
 <s id="131">I'm john@whatmatters.com.</s>
 <s id="132">If we think of the world-changing goals of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, of Google, they're remarkable: ubiquitous computing, affordable health care, high-quality for everyone, ending global poverty, access to all the world's information.</s>
 <s id="133">Here's the deal: every one of those goals is powered today by OKRs.</s>
 <s id="134">Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you to join me in this movement.</s>
 <s id="135">Let's fight for what it is that really matters, because we can take OKRs beyond our businesses.</s>
 <s id="136">We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments.</s>
 <s id="137">We can hold those governments accountable.</s>
 <s id="138">We can transform those informations.</s>
 <s id="139">We can get back on the right track if we can and do measure what really matters.</s>
 <s id="140">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="141">(Applause)</s>
