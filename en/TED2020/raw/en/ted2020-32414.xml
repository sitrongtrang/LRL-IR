 <s id="1">Colfax Avenue, here in Denver, Colorado, was once called the longest, wickedest street in America.</s>
 <s id="2">My office is there in the same place -- it's a medical desert.</s>
 <s id="3">There are government clinics and hospitals nearby, but they're not enough to handle the poor who live in the area.</s>
 <s id="4">By poor, I mean those who are on Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="5">Not just for the homeless; 20 percent of this country is on Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="6">If your neighbors have a family of four and make less than $33,000 a year, then they can get Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="7">But they can't find a doctor to see them.</s>
 <s id="8">A study by Merritt Hawkins found that only 20 percent of the family doctors in Denver take any Medicaid patients.</s>
 <s id="9">And of those 20 percent, some have caps, like five Medicaid patients a month.</s>
 <s id="10">Others make Medicaid patients wait months to be seen, but will see you today, if you have Blue Cross.</s>
 <s id="11">This form of classist discrimination is legal and is not just a problem in Denver.</s>
 <s id="12">Almost half the family doctors in the country refuse to see Medicaid patients.</s>
 <s id="13">Why?</s>
 <s id="14">Well, because Medicaid pays less than private insurance and because Medicaid patients are seen as more challenging.</s>
 <s id="15">Some show up late for appointments, some don't speak English and some have trouble following instructions.</s>
 <s id="16">I thought about this while in medical school.</s>
 <s id="17">If I could design a practice that caters to low-income folks instead of avoiding them, then I would have guaranteed customers and very little competition.</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) So after residency, I opened up shop, doing underserved medicine.</s>
 <s id="19">Not as a nonprofit, but as a private practice.</s>
 <s id="20">A small business seeing only resettled refugees.</s>
 <s id="21">That was six years ago, and since then, we've served 50,000 refugee medical visits.</s>
 <s id="22">(Applause) Ninety percent of our patients have Medicaid, and most of the rest, we see for free.</s>
 <s id="23">Most doctors say you can't make money on Medicaid, but we're doing it just fine.</s>
 <s id="24">How?</s>
 <s id="25">Well, if this were real capitalism, then I wouldn't tell you, because you'd become my competition.</s>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) But I call this "bleeding-heart" capitalism.</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) And we need more people doing this, not less, so here's how.</s>
 <s id="28">We break down the walls of our medical maze by taking the challenges of Medicaid patients, turning them into opportunities, and pocketing the difference.</s>
 <s id="29">The nuts and bolts may seem simple, but they add up.</s>
 <s id="30">For example, we have no appointments.</s>
 <s id="31">We're walk-in only.</s>
 <s id="32">Of course, that's how it works at the emergency room, at urgent cares and at Taco Bell.</s>
 <s id="33">(Laughter) But not usually at family doctor's offices.</s>
 <s id="34">Why do we do it?</s>
 <s id="35">Because Nasra can't call for an appointment.</s>
 <s id="36">She has a phone, but she doesn't have phone minutes.</s>
 <s id="37">She can't speak English, and she can't navigate a phone tree.</s>
 <s id="38">And she can't show up on time for an appointment because she doesn't have a car, she takes the bus, and she takes care of three kids plus her disabled father.</s>
 <s id="39">So we have no appointments; she shows up when she wants, but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen.</s>
 <s id="40">She then spends as much time with us as she needs.</s>
 <s id="41">Sometimes that's 40 minutes, usually it's less than five.</s>
 <s id="42">She loves this flexibility.</s>
 <s id="43">It's how she saw doctors in Somalia.</s>
 <s id="44">And I love it, because I don't pay staff to do scheduling, and we have a zero no-show rate and a zero late-show rate.</s>
 <s id="45">(Laughter) (Applause) It makes business sense.</s>
 <s id="46">Another difference is our office layout.</s>
 <s id="47">Our exam rooms open right to the waiting room, our medical providers room their own patients, and our providers stay in one room instead of alternating between rooms.</s>
 <s id="48">Cutting steps cuts costs and increases customer satisfaction.</s>
 <s id="49">We also hand out free medicines, right from our exam room: over-the-counter ones and some prescription ones, too.</s>
 <s id="50">If Nasra's baby is sick, we put a bottle of children's Tylenol or amoxicillin right in her hand.</s>
 <s id="51">She can take that baby straight back home instead of stopping at the pharmacy.</s>
 <s id="52">I don't know about you, but I get sick just looking at all those choices.</s>
 <s id="53">Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there.</s>
 <s id="54">We also text patients.</s>
 <s id="55">We're open evenings and weekends.</s>
 <s id="56">We do home visits.</s>
 <s id="57">We've jumped dead car batteries.</s>
 <s id="58">(Laughter) With customer satisfaction so high, we've never had to advertise, yet are growing at 25 percent a year.</s>
 <s id="59">And we've become real good at working with Medicaid, since it's pretty much the only insurance company we deal with.</s>
 <s id="60">Other doctor's offices chase 10 insurance companies just to make ends meet.</s>
 <s id="61">That's just draining.</s>
 <s id="62">A single-payer system is like monogamy: it just works better.</s>
 <s id="63">(Laughter) (Applause) Of course, Medicaid is funded by tax payers like you, so you might be wondering, "How much does this cost the system?"</s>
 <s id="64">Well, we're cheaper than the alternatives.</s>
 <s id="65">Some of our patients might go to the emergency room, which can cost thousands, just for a simple cold.</s>
 <s id="66">Some may stay home and let their problems get worse.</s>
 <s id="67">But most would try to make an appointment at a clinic that's part of the system called the Federally Qualified Health Centers.</s>
 <s id="68">This is a nationwide network of safety-net clinics that receive twice as much government funding per visit than private doctors like me.</s>
 <s id="69">Not only they get more money, but by law, there can only be one in each area.</s>
 <s id="70">That means they have a monopoly on special funding for the poor.</s>
 <s id="71">And like any monopoly, there's a tendency for cost to go up and quality to go down.</s>
 <s id="72">I'm not a government entity; I'm not a nonprofit.</s>
 <s id="73">I'm a private practice.</s>
 <s id="74">I have a capitalist drive to innovate.</s>
 <s id="75">I have to be fast and friendly.</s>
 <s id="76">I have to be cost-effective and culturally sensitive.</s>
 <s id="77">I have to be tall, dark and handsome.</s>
 <s id="78">(Laughter) (Applause) And if I'm not, I'm going out of business.</s>
 <s id="79">I can innovate faster than a nonprofit, because I don't need a meeting to move a stapler.</s>
 <s id="80">(Applause) Really, none of our innovations are new or unique -- we just put them together in a unique way to help low-income folks while making money.</s>
 <s id="81">And then, instead of taking that money home, I put it back into the refugee community as a business expense.</s>
 <s id="82">This is Mango House.</s>
 <s id="83">My version of a medical home.</s>
 <s id="84">In it, we have programs to feed and clothe the poor, an after-school program, English classes, churches, dentist, legal help, mental health and the scout groups.</s>
 <s id="85">These programs are run by tenant organizations and amazing staff, but all receive some amount of funding form profits from my clinic.</s>
 <s id="86">Some call this social entrepreneurship.</s>
 <s id="87">I call it social-service arbitrage.</s>
 <s id="88">Exploiting inefficiencies in our health care system to serve the poor.</s>
 <s id="89">We're serving 15,000 refugees a year at less cost than where else they would be going.</s>
 <s id="90">Of course, there's downsides to doing this as a private business, rather than as a nonprofit or a government entity.</s>
 <s id="91">There's taxes and legal exposures.</s>
 <s id="92">There's changing Medicaid rates and specialists who don't take Medicaid.</s>
 <s id="93">And there's bomb threats.</s>
 <s id="94">Notice there's no apostrophes, it's like, "We were going to blow up all you refugees!"</s>
 <s id="95">(Laughter) "We were going to blow up all you refugees, but then we went to your English class, instead."</s>
 <s id="96">(Laughter) (Applause) Now, you might be thinking, "This guy's a bit different."</s>
 <s id="97">(Laughter) Uncommon.</s>
 <s id="98">(Laughter) A communal narcissist?</s>
 <s id="99">(Laughter) A unicorn, maybe, because if this was so easy, then other doctors would be doing it.</s>
 <s id="100">Well, based on Medicaid rates, you can do this in most of the country.</s>
 <s id="101">You can be your own boss, help the poor and make good money doing it.</s>
 <s id="102">Medical folks, you wrote on your school application essays that you wanted to help those less fortunate.</s>
 <s id="103">But then you had your idealism beaten out of you in training.</s>
 <s id="104">Your creativity bred out of you.</s>
 <s id="105">It doesn't have to be that way.</s>
 <s id="106">You can choose underserved medicine as a lifestyle specialty.</s>
 <s id="107">Or you can be a specialist who cuts cost in order to see low-income folks.</s>
 <s id="108">And for the rest of you, who don't work in health care, what did you write on your applications?</s>
 <s id="109">Most of us wanted to save the world, to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="110">Maybe you've been successful in your career but are now looking for that meaning?</s>
 <s id="111">How can you get there?</s>
 <s id="112">I don't just mean giving a few dollars or a few hours; I mean how can you use your expertise to innovate new ways of serving others.</s>
 <s id="113">It might be easier than you think.</s>
 <s id="114">The only way we're going to bridge the underserved medicine gap is by seeing it as a business opportunity.</s>
 <s id="115">The only way we're going to bridge the inequality gap is by recognizing our privileges and using them to help others.</s>
 <s id="116">(Applause)</s>
