 <s id="1">Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.</s>
 <s id="2">As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.</s>
 <s id="3">But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.</s>
 <s id="4">I wanted to visualize the story of life.</s>
 <s id="5">It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted, and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.</s>
 <s id="6">But there were also revelations.</s>
 <s id="7">And one of those I'd like to share with you today.</s>
 <s id="8">I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue.</s>
 <s id="9">There's stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it's the only place they still occur today.</s>
 <s id="10">Going down there was like entering a time capsule, and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.</s>
 <s id="11">The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today.</s>
 <s id="12">Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.</s>
 <s id="13">I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.</s>
 <s id="14">It's a story about you and me, nature and science.</s>
 <s id="15">And with that said, I'd like to invite you for a short, brief journey of life through time.</s>
 <s id="16">Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...</s>
 <s id="17">solidifying into surface, molded by fire.</s>
 <s id="18">The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.</s>
 <s id="19">The moon was closer; things were different.</s>
 <s id="20">Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.</s>
 <s id="21">Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.</s>
 <s id="22">Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.</s>
 <s id="23">And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.</s>
 <s id="24">But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.</s>
 <s id="25">And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.</s>
 <s id="26">It arises around cracks in the Earth.</s>
 <s id="27">Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.</s>
 <s id="28">Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...</s>
 <s id="29">Growing living structures under an alien sky ...</s>
 <s id="30">Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.</s>
 <s id="31">And they changed the atmosphere.</s>
 <s id="32">A breath that's fossilized now as iron.</s>
 <s id="33">Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.</s>
 <s id="34">Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.</s>
 <s id="35">These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ...</s>
 <s id="36">circuit boards of the future.</s>
 <s id="37">Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms.</s>
 <s id="38">It grew as light and oxygen increased.</s>
 <s id="39">Life hardened and became defensive.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">It learned to move and began to see.</s>
  <s id="40.2">The first eyes grew on trilobites.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="41">Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs, among the first to leave the sea.</s>
 <s id="42">They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">Scorpions follow prey out of the sea.</s>
  <s id="43.2">Slugs became snails.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">Fish tried amphibian life.</s>
  <s id="44.2">Frogs adapted to deserts.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">Lichens arose as a co-op.</s>
  <s id="45.2">Fungi married algae ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.</s>
 <s id="47">True land plants arose, leafless at first.</s>
 <s id="48">Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.</s>
 <s id="49">The fundamental forms of ferns followed, to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.</s>
 <s id="50">Life flourished in swamps.</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">On land, life turned a corner.</s>
  <s id="51.2">Jaws formed first; teeth came later.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.</s>
 <s id="53">It took time for life to break away from water, and it still beckons all the time.</s>
 <s id="54">Life turned hard so it could venture inland.</s>
 <s id="55">And the dragons that arose are still among us today.</s>
 <s id="56">Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar, and the center of Brazil, where plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.</s>
 <s id="57">Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.</s>
 <s id="58">One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.</s>
 <s id="59">And others fly today like echoes of the past.</s>
 <s id="60">In birds, life gained new mobility.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">Flamingos covered continents.</s>
  <s id="61.2">Migrations got underway.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.</s>
 <s id="63">Water lilies were among the first.</s>
 <s id="64">Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.</s>
 <s id="65">In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree, and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.</s>
 <s id="66">In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.</s>
 <s id="67">But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.</s>
 <s id="68">Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.</s>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">Fungi multiplied.</s>
  <s id="69.2">Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.</s>
 <s id="71">Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.</s>
 <s id="72">When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.</s>
 <s id="73">Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.</s>
 <s id="74">Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.</s>
 <s id="75">An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.</s>
 <s id="76">But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.</s>
 <s id="77">When the skies cleared, a new world was born.</s>
 <p id="p78">
  <s id="78.1">A world fit for mammals.</s>
  <s id="78.2">From tiny shrews [came] tenrecs, accustomed to the dark.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">New forms became bats.</s>
  <s id="79.2">Civets.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="80">New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.</s>
 <s id="81">Grasslands created opportunities.</s>
 <s id="82">Herd safety came with sharpened senses.</s>
 <s id="83">Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.</s>
 <s id="84">Some mammals turned back to water.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">Walruses adapted with layers of fat.</s>
  <s id="85.2">Sea lions got sleek.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.</s>
 <p id="p87">
  <s id="87.1">There are many ways to be a mammal.</s>
  <s id="87.2">A 'roo hops in Oz; a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="88">Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first, becoming lemurs not much later.</s>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">Learning became reinforced.</s>
  <s id="89.2">Bands of apes ventured into the open.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p90">
  <s id="90.1">And forests dried out once more.</s>
  <s id="90.2">Going upright became a lifestyle.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p91">
  <s id="91.1">So who are we?</s>
  <s id="91.2">Brothers of masculine chimps, sisters of feminine bonobos?</s>
  <s id="91.3">We are all of them, and more.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="92">We're molded by the same life force.</s>
 <s id="93">The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.</s>
 <s id="94">And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">Life is a force in its own right.</s>
  <s id="95.2">It is a new element.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p96">
  <s id="96.1">And it has altered the Earth.</s>
  <s id="96.2">It covers Earth like a skin.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="97">And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.</s>
 <s id="98">But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.</s>
 <s id="99">And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.</s>
 <s id="100">The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath, and vice versa.</s>
 <s id="101">This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.</s>
 <p id="p102">
  <s id="102.1">We call it "atmosphere."</s>
  <s id="102.2">This is the icon of our journey.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="103">And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.</s>
 <p id="p104">
  <s id="104.1">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
  <s id="104.2">Thank you.</s>
