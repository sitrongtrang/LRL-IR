 <s id="1">I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person, so in 22 years as a journalist, I've learned how to do a lot of new things.</s>
 <s id="2">And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible.</s>
 <s id="3">I became one of the working homeless.</s>
 <s id="4">I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year, and decided to travel.</s>
 <s id="5">His death hit me pretty hard.</s>
 <s id="6">And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">I've camped my whole life.</s>
  <s id="7.2">And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van, and drove off into the sunset, having fully failed to realize three critical things.</s>
 <s id="9">One: that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.</s>
 <s id="10">Two: I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality, if we let it.</s>
 <s id="11">Three: I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.</s>
 <s id="12">At first, living in the van was great.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">I showered in campgrounds.</s>
  <s id="13.2">I ate out regularly.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="14">And I had time to relax and to grieve.</s>
 <s id="15">But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">My freelance job ended.</s>
  <s id="16.2">And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer.</s>
 <s id="18">And it became impossible to park anywhere -- (Laughs) -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.</s>
 <s id="19">The cat came and went through an open window in the van.</s>
 <s id="20">The doggy went into doggy day care.</s>
 <s id="21">And I sweated.</s>
 <s id="22">Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.</s>
 <s id="23">Or I washed up in public rest rooms.</s>
 <s id="24">Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.</s>
 <s id="25">Food rotted in the heat.</s>
 <s id="26">Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.</s>
 <s id="27">I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat.</s>
 <s id="28">And I refused to give them up, so I stayed in the van.</s>
 <s id="29">And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing.</s>
  <s id="30.2">And they stayed there.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">And I faced a whole new set of challenges.</s>
 <s id="32">I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.</s>
 <s id="33">I didn't always succeed.</s>
 <s id="34">But I felt out of control of my life.</s>
 <s id="35">And I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman, living in a van, took my breath away.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">I hadn't changed.</s>
  <s id="36.2">My I.Q. hadn't dropped.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">My talent, my integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same.</s>
 <s id="38">But I had changed somehow.</s>
 <s id="39">I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.</s>
 <s id="40">And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">And I went.</s>
  <s id="41.2">I hadn't bathed in three days.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.</s>
 <s id="43">I just wasn't drunk or high.</s>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">And when several of the homeless men realized that, including a former university professor, they said, "You aren't homeless.</s>
  <s id="44.2">Why are you really here?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">Then the professor listened to my story and he said, "You have a job.</s>
  <s id="46.2">You have hope.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">The real homeless don't have hope."</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal.</s>
  <s id="48.2">And I remember thinking, "If I killed myself, no one would notice."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">A friend told me, shortly after that, that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national T.V.</s>
 <s id="50">An essay I'd written about my father, the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">And he was doing the talk show circuit.</s>
  <s id="51.2">And he was talking about my writing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press," was talking about my writing, while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, I started laughing.</s>
 <s id="53">You should too.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) I started laughing because it got to the point where, was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?</s>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">So I went in the bookstore.</s>
  <s id="55.2">And I found Tim's book.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">And I stood there.</s>
  <s id="56.2">And I reread my essay.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">And I cried.</s>
 <s id="58">Because I was a writer.</s>
 <s id="59">I was a writer.</s>
 <s id="60">Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.</s>
 <s id="61">I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.</s>
 <s id="62">And I started writing again.</s>
 <s id="63">By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.</s>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">I was winning awards.</s>
  <s id="64.2">I was living in my own apartment.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">I was no longer homeless.</s>
 <s id="66">And I was no longer invisible.</s>
 <s id="67">Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs, and live in their cars.</s>
 <s id="68">But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.</s>
 <s id="69">So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.</s>
 <s id="70">But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.</s>
 <s id="71">The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.</s>
 <s id="72">And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.</s>
 <s id="73">I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.</s>
 <s id="74">But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep, or what their life situation is at any given time.</s>
 <s id="75">Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot, and today I'm speaking at TED.</s>
 <p id="p76">
  <s id="76.1">Hope always, always finds a way.</s>
  <s id="76.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="77">(Applause)</s>
