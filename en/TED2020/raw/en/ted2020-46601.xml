 <s id="1">Despite a serene sunset on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the Zaporozhian Cossacks.</s>
 <s id="2">The year is 1676, and the Treaty of Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire.</s>
 <s id="3">But as Stepan and his men ride towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds.</s>
 <s id="4">Having made their home in the Wild Fields north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most formidable military forces.</s>
 <s id="5">Composed of hunters, fishermen, nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these fertile unclaimed lands.</s>
 <s id="6">Yet this freedom has proven increasingly difficult to maintain.</s>
 <s id="7">Their decades-long strategy of shifting alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning of their lands.</s>
 <s id="8">In a desperate bid to reclaim independence and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire.</s>
 <s id="9">This alliance successfully freed the Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but their victory was a bitter one.</s>
 <s id="10">Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery.</s>
 <s id="11">And outrage at allying with Muslims against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support.</s>
 <s id="12">Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing on what their next move should be.</s>
 <s id="13">Until then, Stepan must keep order.</s>
 <s id="14">With his musket and curved saber, he cuts an imposing figure.</s>
 <s id="15">He surveys his battalion of 180 men.</s>
 <s id="16">Most are Orthodox Christians and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian.</s>
 <s id="17">But there are also Greeks, Tatars, and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions on recent events.</s>
 <s id="18">Officially, all of Stepan’s men have sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military training and remaining unmarried.</s>
 <s id="19">In practice, some are part-timers, holding more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby villages, outside Cossack lands.</s>
 <s id="20">Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life.</s>
 <s id="21">Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with the tide of military action.</s>
 <s id="22">The settlement is remarkably well- organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, as Cossacks prize literacy.</s>
 <s id="23">Stepan and his men make their way to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several hundred man regiment.</s>
 <s id="24">Inside, the men dine on dried fish, sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine.</s>
 <s id="25">Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to lighten the mood with his bandura.</s>
 <s id="26">But before long, an argument has broken out.</s>
 <s id="27">One of his men has raised a toast to Doroshenko.</s>
 <s id="28">Stepan cuts him off.</s>
 <s id="29">The room is silent until he raises his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance with Moscow against the Turks.</s>
 <s id="30">Stepan plans to support him, and he expects his men to do the same.</s>
 <s id="31">Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, or general council meeting.</s>
 <s id="32">Stepan and the others make their way towards the church square— the center of Sich life.</s>
 <s id="33">Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman camp completely vulnerable on one side.</s>
 <s id="34">Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, and bring unity to the Wild Fields.</s>
 <s id="35">As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed sense of brotherhood.</s>
 <s id="36">Over the next 200 years, these freedom fighters would take on many foes.</s>
 <s id="37">And tragically, they would eventually become the oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed.</s>
 <s id="38">But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of independence and defiance.</s>
 <s id="39">As the Russian painter Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, equality, and fraternity so deeply.”</s>
