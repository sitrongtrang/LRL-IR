 <s id="1">A male firefly glows above a field on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes.</s>
 <s id="2">He hopes a nearby female will respond with her own lightshow and mate with him.</s>
 <s id="3">Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans.</s>
 <s id="4">A female from a different species mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with her promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal.</s>
 <s id="5">He’s been deceived.</s>
 <s id="6">Behavioral biologists have identified three defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident.</s>
 <s id="7">In this case we know that the predatory firefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species.</s>
 <s id="8">Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature?</s>
 <s id="9">Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples of animal trickery.</s>
 <s id="10">The leaf-tailed gecko and the octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces on which they rest.</s>
 <s id="11">Other animals use mimicry to protect themselves.</s>
 <s id="12">Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings these markings convey.</s>
 <s id="13">Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like female wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant.</s>
 <s id="14">Some of these animals benefit by having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited to their environments.</s>
 <s id="15">But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate the reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly.</s>
 <s id="16">Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors to match its surroundings.</s>
 <s id="17">Dwarf chameleons color-match their environments more closely when they see a bird predator rather than a snake– birds, after all, have better color vision.</s>
 <s id="18">One of the more fascinating examples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo.</s>
 <s id="19">This bird sits atop tall trees in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators and calling when it senses a threat.</s>
 <s id="20">That sends meerkats, pied babblers, and others dashing for cover.</s>
 <s id="21">But the drongo will also sound a false alarm when those other species have captured prey.</s>
 <s id="22">As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down to steal their catches.</s>
 <s id="23">This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos with much of their food.</s>
 <s id="24">There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members of their own species, but that happens too.</s>
 <s id="25">Consider the mantis shrimp.</s>
 <s id="26">Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body vulnerable to attack.</s>
 <s id="27">But it’s still driven to protect its home against rivals.</s>
 <s id="28">So it has become a masterful bluffer.</s>
 <s id="29">Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually more likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses to strike or stab its opponents.</s>
 <s id="30">And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep their homes than non-bluffers.</s>
 <s id="31">In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t withstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff.</s>
 <s id="32">Biologists have even noticed that its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely to bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely to be driven away.</s>
 <s id="33">It would seem that instead of just threatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the situation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result.</s>
 <s id="34">So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent?</s>
 <s id="35">That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think we'll never be able to answer it.</s>
 <s id="36">We can't observe animals’ internal thoughts.</s>
 <s id="37">But we don’t need to know what an animal is thinking in order to detect deception.</s>
 <s id="38">By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate predators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.</s>
