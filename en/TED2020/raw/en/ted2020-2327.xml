 <s id="1">Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!</s>
 <s id="2">(Applause) Thanks, Pat.</s>
 <s id="3">Thank you!</s>
 <s id="4">Getting me all wound up, now!</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) Pat Mitchell: Good!</s>
 <s id="6">You know, when I was watching the video again of the match, you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took.</s>
 <s id="7">Were you feeling that?</s>
 <s id="8">BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs -- he was the former number one player, he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.</s>
 <s id="9">He was one of my heroes and I admired him.</s>
 <s id="10">And that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him.</s>
 <s id="11">(Laughter) It's true -- my mom and especially my dad always said: "Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever."</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">And he was correct.</s>
  <s id="12.2">He was absolutely correct.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">But I knew it was about social change.</s>
 <s id="14">And I was really nervous whenever we announced it, and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders.</s>
 <s id="15">And I thought, "If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least."</s>
 <s id="16">Title IX had just been passed the year before -- June 23, 1972.</s>
 <s id="17">And women's professional tennis -- there were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 -- now remember, the match is in '73.</s>
 <s id="18">So we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living.</s>
 <s id="19">So there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract.</s>
 <s id="20">And our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world -- if she was good enough -- there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living.</s>
 <s id="21">Because before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day, and we were under the control of organizations.</s>
 <s id="22">So we really wanted to break away from that.</s>
 <s id="23">But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much; we knew it was about the future generations.</s>
 <s id="24">We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question.</s>
 <s id="25">But every generation has the chance to make it better.</s>
 <s id="26">That was really on my mind.</s>
 <s id="27">I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX.</s>
 <s id="28">Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't, said that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university, either public or private, had to -- finally -- give equal monies to boys and girls.</s>
 <s id="29">And that changed everything.</s>
 <s id="30">(Applause) So you can have a law, but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it.</s>
 <s id="31">That's when it really rocks, totally.</s>
 <s id="32">So that was on my mind.</s>
 <s id="33">I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds.</s>
 <s id="34">But two things came out of that match.</s>
 <s id="35">For women: self-confidence, empowerment.</s>
 <s id="36">They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise.</s>
 <s id="37">Some women have waited 10, 15 years to ask.</s>
 <s id="38">I said, "More importantly, did you get it?"</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) And they did!</s>
 <s id="40">And for the men?</s>
 <s id="41">A lot of the men today don't realize it, but if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s, you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement -- whether you like it or not!</s>
 <s id="42">(Laughter) (Applause) And for the men, what happened for the men, they'd come up to me -- and most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes, it's very interesting.</s>
 <s id="43">They go, "Billie, I was very young when I saw that match, and now I have a daughter.</s>
 <s id="44">And I am so happy I saw that as a young man."</s>
 <s id="45">And one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama.</s>
 <s id="46">And he actually told me that when I met him, he said: "You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12.</s>
 <s id="47">And now I have two daughters, and it has made a difference in how I raise them."</s>
 <s id="48">So both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things.</s>
 <s id="49">PM: And now there are generations -- at least one or two -- who have experienced the equality that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible.</s>
 <s id="50">And for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork.</s>
 <s id="51">They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before.</s>
 <s id="52">So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete, a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the Women's Sports Foundation.</s>
 <s id="53">What now are you looking to accomplish with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?</s>
 <s id="54">BJK: I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12.</s>
 <s id="55">At 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world, and a friend had asked me to play and I said, "What's that?"</s>
 <s id="56">Tennis was not in my family -- basketball was, other sports.</s>
 <s id="57">Fast forward to 12 years old, (Laughter) and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year.</s>
 <s id="58">So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was, but also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes, played with white balls -- everybody who played was white.</s>
 <s id="59">And I said to myself, at 12 years old, "Where is everyone else?"</s>
 <s id="60">And that just kept sticking in my brain.</s>
 <s id="61">And that moment, I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life.</s>
 <s id="62">And that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one -- and I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence, already at that age -- that I had this platform.</s>
 <s id="63">And tennis is global.</s>
 <s id="64">And I thought, "You know what?</s>
 <s id="65">I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had."</s>
 <s id="66">I didn't know if I was going to make it -- this was only 12.</s>
 <s id="67">I sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion.</s>
 <s id="68">I just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word.</s>
 <s id="69">That's who I truly am, just fighting for people.</s>
 <s id="70">And, unfortunately, women have had less.</s>
 <s id="71">And we are considered less.</s>
 <s id="72">And so my attentions, where did they have to go?</s>
 <s id="73">It was just ... you have to.</s>
 <s id="74">And learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice.</s>
 <s id="75">You hear the same words keep coming out all the time, and I got really lucky because I had an education.</s>
 <s id="76">And I think if you can see it you can be it, you know?</s>
 <s id="77">If you can see it, you can be it.</s>
 <s id="78">You look at Pat, you look at other leaders, you look at these speakers, look at yourself, because everyone -- everyone -- can do something extraordinary.</s>
 <s id="79">Every single person.</s>
 <s id="80">PM: And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere.</s>
 <s id="81">Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, you're taking on an even bigger cause.</s>
 <s id="82">Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice, working to find their way into leadership positions.</s>
 <s id="83">But what you're talking about is even bigger than that.</s>
 <s id="84">It's inclusive leadership.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively -- BJK: Isn't it great?</s>
  <s id="85.2">Look at the technology!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p86">
  <s id="86.1">It's amazing how it connects us all!</s>
  <s id="86.2">It's about connection.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="87">It's simply amazing what's possible because of it.</s>
 <s id="88">But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative is really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it, so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves.</s>
 <s id="89">Because most of us have two jobs: One, to fit in -- I'll give you a perfect example.</s>
 <s id="90">An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work, straightens her hair in the bathroom, goes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day to keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in.</s>
 <s id="91">So she's working two jobs.</s>
 <s id="92">She's got this other job, whatever that may be, but she's also trying to fit in.</s>
 <s id="93">Or this poor man who kept his diploma -- he went to University of Michigan, but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever -- just would not mention it.</s>
 <s id="94">So he made sure they saw he was well-educated.</s>
 <s id="95">And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL -- which means American football for all of you out there, it's a big deal, it's very macho -- and he talked about football all the time, because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know.</s>
 <s id="96">It just goes on and on.</s>
 <s id="97">So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7, that would be the ultimate.</s>
 <s id="98">And we catch ourselves -- I mean, I catch myself to this day.</s>
 <s id="99">Even being gay I catch myself, you know, like, (Gasp) a little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut, feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin.</s>
 <s id="100">So, I think you have to ask yourself -- I want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be.</s>
 <s id="101">PM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that, that these examples you just used -- that many of us have the problem of being authentic.</s>
 <s id="102">But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation, who have benefited from all these equal opportunities -- which may not be equal but exist everywhere -- BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.</s>
 <s id="103">Partnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing.</s>
 <s id="104">That's really the reason I'm able to do this.</s>
 <s id="105">I've had two times in my life where I've actually had men really behind me with power.</s>
 <s id="106">And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims, and this is the second time in my entire life.</s>
 <s id="107">And then Deloitte.</s>
 <s id="108">The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.</s>
 <s id="109">So Deloitte sent out a survey, and over 4,000 people now have answered, and we're continuing in the workplace.</s>
 <s id="110">And what do the millennials feel?</s>
 <s id="111">Well, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is -- you know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation."</s>
 <s id="112">So if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented.</s>
 <s id="113">That's not good enough anymore, which is so good!</s>
 <s id="114">So the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement.</s>
 <s id="115">They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking, and get into the solution.</s>
 <s id="116">They're problem-solvers, and of course, you've got the information at your fingertips, compared to when I was growing up.</s>
 <s id="117">PM: What did the research show you about millennials?</s>
 <s id="118">Are they going to make a difference?</s>
 <s id="119">Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?</s>
 <s id="120">BJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials.</s>
 <s id="121">I think they are going to help solve problems.</s>
 <s id="122">I think they have the wherewithal to do it.</s>
 <s id="123">I know they care a lot.</s>
 <s id="124">They have big ideas and they can make big things happen.</s>
 <s id="125">I want to stay in the now with the young people, I don't want to get behind.</s>
 <s id="126">(Laughter) PM: I don't think there's any chance!</s>
 <s id="127">But what you found out in the research about millennials is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials.</s>
 <s id="128">BJK: No, well, if we want to talk -- OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.</s>
 <s id="129">I've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go, "What do you think about the millennials?"</s>
 <s id="130">And I'm pretty excited, like it's good, and they get this face -- (Laughter) "Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"</s>
 <s id="131">(Laughter) I say, "Do you really think so?</s>
 <s id="132">Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things."</s>
 <s id="133">And they go, "Oh, Billie, they cannot focus."</s>
 <s id="134">(Laughter) They actually have proven that the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.</s>
 <s id="135">(Laughter) They can't focus.</s>
 <s id="136">And they don't really care.</s>
 <s id="137">I just heard a story the other night: a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers.</s>
 <s id="138">She gets a text from one of the workers, like an intern, she's just starting -- she goes, "Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's."</s>
 <s id="139">(Laughter) So she arrives, and this boss says, "What's going on?"</s>
 <s id="140">And she says, "Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?"</s>
 <p id="p141">
  <s id="141.1">She says, "Well, guess what?</s>
  <s id="141.2">I'd like you leave, you're finished."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="142">She goes, "OK."</s>
 <s id="143">(Laughter) No problem!</s>
 <s id="144">PM: Now Billie, that story -- I know, but that's what scares the boomers -- I'm just telling you -- so I think it's good for us to share.</s>
 <s id="145">(Laughter) No, it is good for us to share, because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling, so we've got to take it both ways, you know?</s>
 <s id="146">But I have great faith because -- if you've been in sports like I have -- every generation gets better.</s>
 <s id="147">It's a fact.</s>
 <s id="148">With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still, because we're trying to keep protecting the law, because it's in a tenuous position always, so we really are concerned, and we do a lot of research.</s>
 <s id="149">That's very important to us.</s>
 <s id="150">And I want to hear from people.</s>
 <s id="151">But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide.</s>
 <s id="152">And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected.</s>
 <s id="153">And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls, at least in sports, have gone up against -- whatever institutions -- has won?</s>
 <s id="154">Title IX is there to protect us.</s>
 <s id="155">And it is amazing.</s>
 <s id="156">But we still have to get the hearts and minds -- the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge.</s>
 <s id="157">PM: So what gets you up every morning?</s>
 <s id="158">What keeps you sustaining your work, sustaining the fight for equality, extending it, always exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... ?</s>
 <s id="159">BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one.</s>
 <s id="160">I'm highly motivated.</s>
 <s id="161">My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player.</s>
 <s id="162">My poor parents did not care if we were any good.</s>
 <s id="163">(Laughter) And we drove them crazy because we pushed, we pushed because we wanted to be the best.</s>
 <s id="164">And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks.</s>
 <s id="165">I think to listen to these different women, to listen to different people, to listen to President Carter -- 90 years old, by the way, and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never -- I'd have to go, "Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures."</s>
 <s id="166">He was rattling off -- I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.</s>
 <s id="167">PM: He's an amazing man.</s>
 <p id="p168">
  <s id="168.1">(Applause) BJK: And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson, who's a former president -- Thank you, Irish! 62 percent!</s>
  <s id="168.2">LGBTQ!</s>
  <s id="168.3">Yes!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="169">(Applause) Congress is voting in June on same-sex marriage, so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear.</s>
 <s id="170">But always remember, every one of us is an individual, a human being with a beating heart, who cares and wants to live their authentic life.</s>
 <p id="p171">
  <s id="171.1">OK?</s>
  <s id="171.2">You don't have to agree with somebody, but everyone has the opportunity.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="172">I think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward, always.</s>
 <s id="173">And these people have been so inspiring.</s>
 <s id="174">Everyone matters.</s>
 <s id="175">And every one of you is an influencer.</s>
 <s id="176">You out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here -- every single person's an influencer.</s>
 <p id="p177">
  <s id="177.1">Never, ever forget that.</s>
  <s id="177.2">OK?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="178">So don't ever give up on yourself.</s>
 <s id="179">PM: Billie, you have been an inspiration for us.</s>
 <s id="180">BJK: Thanks, Pat!</s>
 <s id="181">(Applause) Thanks, TED!</s>
 <s id="182">(Applause) Thanks a lot!</s>
