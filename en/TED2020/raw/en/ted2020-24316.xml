 <s id="1">When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story.</s>
 <s id="2">Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray.</s>
 <s id="3">So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry about its effects?</s>
 <s id="4">The answer begins with understanding that the word radiation describes two very different scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation.</s>
 <s id="5">Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical and magnetic waves oscillating through space.</s>
 <s id="6">As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy.</s>
 <s id="7">At the lower end of the spectrum, there's radio, infrared, and visible light.</s>
 <s id="8">At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays.</s>
 <s id="9">Modern society is shaped by sending and detecting electromagnetic radiation.</s>
 <s id="10">We might download an email to our phone via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen emits visible light.</s>
 <s id="11">Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other due to their mutually positive charges.</s>
 <s id="12">A phenomenon known as the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact.</s>
 <s id="13">However, some combinations of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive.</s>
 <s id="14">They will randomly eject matter and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability.</s>
 <s id="15">Nuclear radiation comes from natural sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground.</s>
 <s id="16">We also refine naturally occurring radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants.</s>
 <s id="17">Even bananas contain trace amounts of a radioactive potassium isotope.</s>
 <s id="18">So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects?</s>
 <s id="19">To start, not all radiation is hazardous.</s>
 <s id="20">Radiation becomes risky when it rips atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA.</s>
 <s id="21">This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost or gained electrons is called an ion.</s>
 <s id="22">All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy electromagnetic radiation is.</s>
 <s id="23">That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet.</s>
 <s id="24">That's why as an extra precaution during X-rays, doctors shield body parts they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen.</s>
 <s id="25">In comparison, cell phones and microwaves operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation from their use.</s>
 <s id="26">The biggest health risk occurs when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure.</s>
 <s id="27">Acute exposures overwhelm the body's natural ability to repair the damage.</s>
 <s id="28">This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death.</s>
 <s id="29">Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources.</s>
 <s id="30">Scientists have a harder time quantifying these risks.</s>
 <s id="31">Your body often repairs damage from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest for a decade or more.</s>
 <s id="32">One way scientists compare ionizing radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert.</s>
 <s id="33">An acute exposure to one sievert will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal.</s>
 <s id="34">However, our normal daily exposures are far lower.</s>
 <s id="35">The average person receives 6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon.</s>
 <s id="36">At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage.</s>
 <s id="37">And remember that banana?</s>
 <s id="38">If you could absorb all the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day to hit your annual dosage.</s>
 <s id="39">We live in a world of radiation.</s>
 <s id="40">However, much of that radiation is non-ionizing.</s>
 <s id="41">For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home tested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce the associated health risks.</s>
 <s id="42">Marie Curie, one of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood.</s>
 <s id="43">Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."</s>
