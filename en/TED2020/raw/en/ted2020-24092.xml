 <s id="1">Tattoos have often been presented in popular media as either marks of the dangerous and deviant or trendy youth fads.</s>
 <s id="2">But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed greatly across cultures, the practice is as old as civilization itself.</s>
 <s id="3">Decorative skin markings have been discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE.</s>
 <s id="4">But have you ever wondered how tattooing really works?</s>
 <s id="5">You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000 skin cells per hour.</s>
 <s id="6">That's about 1,000,000 per day.</s>
 <s id="7">So, how come the tattoo doesn't gradually flake off along with them?</s>
 <s id="8">The simple answer is that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed.</s>
 <s id="9">Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods to accomplish this.</s>
 <s id="10">But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's engraving machine and ran on electricity.</s>
 <s id="11">Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles, loaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50 to 3,000 times per minute.</s>
 <s id="12">The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers, nerves, glands, blood vessels and more.</s>
 <s id="13">Every time a needle penetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin the inflammatory process, calling immune system cells to the wound site to begin repairing the skin.</s>
 <s id="14">And it is this very process that makes tattoos permanent.</s>
 <s id="15">First, specialized cells called macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt to clean up the inflammatory mess.</s>
 <s id="16">As these cells travel through the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly full of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis.</s>
 <s id="17">With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain visible through the skin.</s>
 <s id="18">Some of the ink particles are also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed by dermal cells called fibroblasts.</s>
 <s id="19">Initially, ink is deposited into the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged epidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling off like a heeling sunburn.</s>
 <s id="20">Blistering or crusting is not typically seen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal regeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess sun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading.</s>
 <s id="21">Dermal cells, however, remain in place until they die.</s>
 <s id="22">When they do, they are taken up, ink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is.</s>
 <s id="23">But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts to the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down to be carried off by the immune system's macrophages.</s>
 <s id="24">Ultraviolet radiation can also contribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated by the use of sunblock.</s>
 <s id="25">But since the dermal cells are relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep in the skin for a person's whole life.</s>
 <s id="26">But if tattoos are embedded in your skin for life, is there any way to erase them?</s>
 <s id="27">Technically, yes.</s>
 <s id="28">Today, a laser is used to penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment colors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target.</s>
 <s id="29">The laser beam breaks the ink globules into smaller particles that can then be cleared away by the macrophages.</s>
 <s id="30">But some color inks are harder to remove than others, and there could be complications.</s>
 <s id="31">For this reason, removing a tattoo is still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible.</s>
 <s id="32">So a single tattoo may not truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer than any existing culture.</s>
 <s id="33">And their continuing popularity means that the art of tattooing is here to stay.</s>
