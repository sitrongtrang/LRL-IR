 <s id="1">Deep in the jungles of Vietnam, soldiers from both sides battled heat exhaustion and each other for nearly 20 long years.</s>
 <s id="2">But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or stamina, it was a dirt road.</s>
 <s id="3">The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops, and psychological support to the South.</s>
 <s id="4">The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos.</s>
 <s id="5">The journey to the South originally took six months.</s>
 <s id="6">But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail.</s>
 <s id="7">Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week.</s>
 <s id="8">Here is how it happened.</s>
 <s id="9">In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam.</s>
 <s id="10">The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction.</s>
 <s id="11">Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam.</s>
 <s id="12">They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf.</s>
 <s id="13">They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body.</s>
 <s id="14">The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery.</s>
 <s id="15">Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats.</s>
 <s id="16">Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out.</s>
 <s id="17">Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions.</s>
 <s id="18">And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers.</s>
 <s id="19">The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting.</s>
 <s id="20">And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song.</s>
 <s id="21">By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck.</s>
 <s id="22">Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground.</s>
 <s id="23">As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing.</s>
 <s id="24">They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft.</s>
 <s id="25">Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks.</s>
 <s id="26">Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!"</s>
 <s id="27">and, "We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through."</s>
 <s id="28">Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads.</s>
 <s id="29">Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads.</s>
 <s id="30">The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny.</s>
 <s id="31">The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success.</s>
 <s id="32">North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin.</s>
 <s id="33">Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century."</s>
 <s id="34">The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.</s>
