 <s id="1">I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved.</s>
 <s id="2">I'd like to start with a little experiment.</s>
 <s id="3">Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses, or you've had laser refractive surgery?</s>
 <s id="4">Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.</s>
 <s id="5">But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.</s>
 <s id="6">The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.</s>
 <s id="7">They also have an estimate of around a billion.</s>
 <s id="8">But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.</s>
 <s id="9">And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">Glasses are not very expensive.</s>
  <s id="10.2">They're quite plentiful.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.</s>
 <s id="12">There are just way too few eye care professionals.</s>
 <s id="13">So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the U.K.</s>
 <s id="14">This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.</s>
 <s id="15">In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">How do you do this?</s>
  <s id="16.2">How do you solve this problem?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">I came up with a solution to this problem, and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.</s>
 <s id="18">And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem.</s>
 <s id="19">What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses.</s>
  <s id="20.2">I shall pop this in my pocket.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">I'm short sighted.</s>
  <s id="21.2">I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there, and I can see that guy running out there.</s>
 <s id="23">I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.</s>
 <s id="24">Next step in my process.</s>
 <s id="25">So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.</s>
 <s id="26">Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...</s>
 <s id="27">Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">...</s>
  <s id="28.2">I've just ...</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">And I've now made some glasses.</s>
  <s id="29.2">That's it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">(Applause) Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.</s>
 <s id="31">In fact, this technology's been evolving.</s>
 <s id="32">I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.</s>
 <s id="33">There are about 30,000 in use now.</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">And they're in fifteen countries.</s>
  <s id="34.2">They're spread around the world.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.</s>
 <s id="36">I have a global vision for vision.</s>
 <s id="37">And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.</s>
 <s id="38">To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.</s>
 <s id="39">The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down.</s>
 <s id="40">This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.</s>
 <s id="41">But the cost has to be brought right down.</s>
 <s id="42">It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day.</s>
 <s id="43">How do you solve this problem?</s>
 <s id="44">You start to get into detail.</s>
 <s id="45">And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">How do you distribute?</s>
  <s id="46.2">How do you work out how to fit the thing?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?</s>
 <s id="48">How do you deal with the industry?</s>
 <s id="49">And the answer to that is research.</s>
 <s id="50">What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university.</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website.</s>
  <s id="51.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">(Applause)</s>
