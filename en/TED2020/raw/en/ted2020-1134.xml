 <s id="1">So for the past year and a half, my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book.</s>
 <s id="2">It's called "Our Choice" and the author is Al Gore.</s>
 <s id="3">It's the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis.</s>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">The book starts like this.</s>
  <s id="4.2">This is the cover.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.</s>
 <s id="6">Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.</s>
 <s id="7">And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.</s>
 <s id="8">And anything you see in the book, you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up.</s>
 <s id="9">And if you want to go back and read the book again, you just fold it back up and put it back on the page.</s>
 <s id="10">And so this works the same way; you pick it up and pop it open.</s>
 <s id="11">(Audio) Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.</s>
 <s id="12">Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.</s>
 <s id="13">This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.</s>
 <s id="14">Zoom into it and see where it was taken.</s>
 <s id="15">And throughout the book, there's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations.</s>
 <s id="16">So you can open this one.</s>
 <s id="17">(Audio) AG: Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...</s>
 <s id="18">MM: It starts playing immediately.</s>
 <s id="19">And while it's playing, we can pinch and peak back at the page, and the movie keeps playing.</s>
 <s id="20">Or we can zoom out to the table of contents, and the video keeps playing.</s>
 <s id="21">But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics.</s>
 <s id="22">This one shows the wind potential all around the United States.</s>
 <s id="23">But instead of just showing us the information, we can take our finger and explore, and see, state by state, exactly how much wind potential there is.</s>
 <s id="24">We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power.</s>
 <s id="25">This is one of my favorites.</s>
 <s id="26">So this shows ...</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) (Applause) When the wind is blowing, any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery.</s>
 <s id="28">And as the wind starts dying down, any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out.</s>
 <s id="29">And this whole book, it doesn't just run on the iPad.</s>
 <s id="30">It also runs on the iPhone.</s>
 <s id="31">And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone.</s>
 <s id="32">And it works the exact same way.</s>
 <s id="33">You can pinch into any page.</s>
 <s id="34">Open it up.</s>
 <s id="35">So that's Push Pop Press' first title, Al Gore's "Our Choice."</s>
 <s id="36">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="37">(Applause) Chris Anderson: That's spectacular.</s>
 <s id="38">Do you want to be a publisher, a technology licenser?</s>
 <s id="39">What is the business here?</s>
 <s id="40">Is this something that other people can do?</s>
 <s id="41">MM: Yeah, we're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content.</s>
 <s id="42">So Melcher Media's team, who's on the East coast -- and we're on the West coast, building the software -- takes our tool and, every day, drags in images and text.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">CA: So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that?</s>
  <s id="43.2">(MM: Yes.)</s>
  <s id="43.3">All right.</s>
  <s id="43.4">Mike, thanks so much.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">MM: Thank you.</s>
  <s id="44.2">(CA: Good luck.)</s>
  <s id="44.3">(Applause)</s>
