 <s id="1">So, my journey began in the Bronx, New York, in a one-bedroom apartment, with my two sisters and immigrant mother.</s>
 <s id="2">I loved our neighborhood.</s>
 <s id="3">It was lively.</s>
 <s id="4">There was all this merengue blasting, neighbors socializing on building stoops and animated conversations over domino playing.</s>
 <s id="5">It was home, and it was sweet.</s>
 <s id="6">But it wasn't simple.</s>
 <s id="7">In fact, everyone at school knew the block where we lived, because it was where people came to buy weed and other drugs.</s>
 <s id="8">And with drug-dealing comes conflict, so we often went to sleep to the sound of gunshots.</s>
 <s id="9">I spent much of my childhood worried, worried about our safety.</s>
 <s id="10">And so did our mother.</s>
 <s id="11">She worried that the violence we witnessed would overtake our lives; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom we lived and shared space would harm us.</s>
 <s id="12">Our entire life was in the Bronx, but my mother's anxiety spurred her into action, and soon we were driving so fast to Connecticut -- (Laughter) to boarding school campuses, with full scholarships in tow.</s>
 <s id="13">Man, don't underestimate the power of a mother determined to keep her children safe.</s>
 <s id="14">(Cheers) (Applause) At boarding school, for the first time, I was able to sleep without worry.</s>
 <s id="15">I could leave my dorm room unlocked, walk barefoot in the grass, and look up to see a night sky full of stars.</s>
 <s id="16">Happy novelties.</s>
 <s id="17">But there were other novelties as well.</s>
 <s id="18">Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.</s>
 <s id="19">I learned that I didn't speak the right way, and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking, my teachers gave me frequent lessons, in public, on the appropriate way to enunciate certain words.</s>
 <s id="20">A teacher once instructed me in the hallway: "Aaaaaas-king."</s>
 <s id="21">She said this loudly.</s>
 <s id="22">"Dena, it's not 'axing,' like you're running around with an axe.</s>
 <s id="23">That's silly."</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Now at this point, you can imagine the snickers of my classmates, but she continued: "Think about breaking the word into 'ass' and 'king,' and then put the two together to say it correctly -- 'Asking.'"</s>
  <s id="24.2">There were some other moments that reminded me that I didn't belong.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">Once, I walked into a classmate's dorm room, and I watched her watch her valuables around me.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">Like, why would she do that?</s>
  <s id="26.2">I thought to myself.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">And then there was the time when another classmate walked into my dorm room, and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying hair grease to my scalp.</s>
 <s id="28">There is emotional damage done when young people can't be themselves, when they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable.</s>
 <s id="29">It's a kind of violence.</s>
 <s id="30">Ultimately, I'm a quintessential success story.</s>
 <s id="31">I attended boarding school and college in New England, studied abroad in Chile and returned to the Bronx to be a middle school teacher.</s>
 <s id="32">I received a Truman Scholarship, a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.</s>
 <s id="33">And I could list more.</s>
 <s id="34">(Laughter) But I won't.</s>
 <s id="35">(Laughter) I earned my doctorate at Columbia University.</s>
 <s id="36">(Cheers) (Applause) And then I landed a job at Yale.</s>
 <s id="37">(Applause) I am proud of everything that I've been able to accomplish on my journey thus far.</s>
 <s id="38">I have eternal imposter syndrome.</s>
 <s id="39">Either I've been invited because I'm a token, which really isn't about me, but rather, about a box someone needed to check off.</s>
 <s id="40">Or, I am exceptional, which means I've had to leave the people I love behind.</s>
 <s id="41">It's the price that I and so many others pay for learning while black.</s>
 <s id="42">(Applause) I police myself all the time.</s>
 <s id="43">Are my pants too tight?</s>
 <s id="44">Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?</s>
 <s id="45">Should I speak up for myself, or will the power of my words be reduced to: "She's angry"?</s>
 <s id="46">Why did I have to leave the Bronx to gain access to a better education?</s>
 <s id="47">And why, in the process of getting that better education, did I have to endure the trauma of erasing what made me, me -- a black girl from the Bronx, raised by an Antiguan mother?</s>
 <s id="48">So when I think about our current education reform initiatives, I can't help asking: What are our students of color learning about themselves?</s>
 <s id="49">Three -- three decades of research reveal that students of color are suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater than white students, and are punished in harsher ways for the same infractions.</s>
 <s id="50">They also learn this through the absence of their lives and narratives in the curricula.</s>
 <s id="51">The Cooperative Children's Book Center did a review of nearly 4,000 books and found that only three percent were about African-Americans.</s>
 <s id="52">And they further learn this through the lack of teachers that look like them.</s>
 <s id="53">An analysis of data from the National Center for Education Statistics found that 45 percent of our nation's pre-K to high school students were people of color, while only 17 percent of our teachers are.</s>
 <s id="54">Our youth of color pay a profound price when their schooling sends them the message that they must be controlled, that they must leave their identities at home in order to be successful.</s>
 <s id="55">Every child deserves an education that guarantees the safety to learn in the comfort of one's own skin.</s>
 <s id="56">(Applause) It is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically.</s>
 <s id="57">I know, because I did it in my classroom when I returned to teach in the Bronx.</s>
 <s id="58">So what did that look like?</s>
 <s id="59">I centered my instruction on the lives, histories and identities of my students.</s>
 <s id="60">And I did all of this because I wanted my students to know that everyone around them was supporting them to be their best self.</s>
 <s id="61">So while I could not control the instability of their homes, the uncertainty of their next meal, or the loud neighbors that kept them from sleep, I provided them with a loving classroom that made them feel proud of who they are, that made them know that they mattered.</s>
 <s id="62">You know, every time I hear or say the word "asking," I am in high school again.</s>
 <s id="63">I am thinking about "ass" and "king" and putting the two together so that I speak in a way where someone in power will want to listen.</s>
 <s id="64">There is a better way, one that doesn't force kids of color into a double bind; a way for them to preserve their ties to their families, homes and communities; a way that teaches them to trust their instincts and to have faith in their own creative genius.</s>
 <s id="65">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="66">(Applause)</s>
