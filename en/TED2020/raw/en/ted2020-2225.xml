 <s id="1">When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.</s>
 <s id="2">That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement, filled with cans of food and water.</s>
 <s id="3">When the nuclear attack came, we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.</s>
 <s id="4">Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this.</s>
 <s id="5">Instead, it looks like this.</s>
 <s id="6">If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.</s>
 <s id="7">Not missiles, but microbes.</s>
 <s id="8">Now, part of the reason for this is that we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.</s>
 <s id="9">But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.</s>
 <s id="10">We're not ready for the next epidemic.</s>
 <s id="11">Let's look at Ebola.</s>
 <s id="12">I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper, lots of tough challenges.</s>
 <s id="13">I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication.</s>
 <s id="14">And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough, the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.</s>
 <s id="15">In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.</s>
 <s id="16">We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone, seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.</s>
 <s id="17">The case reports came in on paper.</s>
 <s id="18">It was very delayed before they were put online and they were extremely inaccurate.</s>
 <s id="19">We didn't have a medical team ready to go.</s>
 <s id="20">We didn't have a way of preparing people.</s>
 <s id="21">Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.</s>
 <s id="22">But even so, we were far slower than we should have been getting the thousands of workers into these countries.</s>
 <s id="23">And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.</s>
 <s id="24">There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.</s>
 <s id="25">No one to look at the diagnostics.</s>
 <s id="26">No one to figure out what tools should be used.</s>
 <s id="27">As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors, processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.</s>
 <s id="28">But that was never tried.</s>
 <s id="29">So there was a lot that was missing.</s>
 <s id="30">And these things are really a global failure.</s>
 <s id="31">The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.</s>
 <s id="32">Now, in the movies it's quite different.</s>
 <s id="33">There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go, they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.</s>
 <s id="34">The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.</s>
 <s id="35">About 10,000 people died, and nearly all were in the three West African countries.</s>
 <s id="36">There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.</s>
 <s id="37">The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.</s>
 <s id="38">They found the people and they prevented more infections.</s>
 <s id="39">The second is the nature of the virus.</s>
 <s id="40">Ebola does not spread through the air.</s>
 <s id="41">And by the time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden.</s>
 <s id="42">Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.</s>
 <s id="43">And that was just luck.</s>
 <s id="44">If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas, the case numbers would have been much larger.</s>
 <s id="45">So next time, we might not be so lucky.</s>
 <s id="46">You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market.</s>
 <s id="47">The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism.</s>
 <s id="48">So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.</s>
 <s id="49">In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.</s>
 <s id="50">So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.</s>
 <s id="51">And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.</s>
 <s id="52">So this is a serious problem.</s>
 <s id="53">We should be concerned.</s>
 <s id="54">But in fact, we can build a really good response system.</s>
 <s id="55">We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.</s>
 <s id="56">We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them.</s>
 <s id="57">We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.</s>
 <s id="58">We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.</s>
 <s id="59">So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.</s>
 <s id="60">And we need preparedness.</s>
 <s id="61">The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again, what we do for war.</s>
 <s id="62">For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.</s>
 <s id="63">We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.</s>
 <s id="64">NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.</s>
 <s id="65">NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?</s>
 <s id="66">Do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies?</s>
 <s id="67">So they are absolutely ready to go.</s>
 <s id="68">So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.</s>
 <s id="69">What are the key pieces?</s>
 <s id="70">First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.</s>
 <s id="71">That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines.</s>
 <s id="72">But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.</s>
 <s id="73">We need a medical reserve corps: lots of people who've got the training and background who are ready to go, with the expertise.</s>
 <s id="74">And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.</s>
 <s id="75">taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics and secure areas.</s>
 <s id="76">We need to do simulations, germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.</s>
 <s id="77">The last time a germ game was done in the United States was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.</s>
 <s id="78">So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.</s>
 <s id="79">Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.</s>
 <s id="80">There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus, that could work very, very quickly.</s>
 <s id="81">Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost, but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.</s>
 <s id="82">The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic, global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.</s>
 <s id="83">These investments offer significant benefits beyond just being ready for the epidemic.</s>
 <s id="84">The primary healthcare, the R&amp;amp;D, those things would reduce global health equity and make the world more just as well as more safe.</s>
 <s id="85">So I think this should absolutely be a priority.</s>
 <s id="86">There's no need to panic.</s>
 <s id="87">We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.</s>
 <s id="88">But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.</s>
 <s id="89">In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.</s>
 <s id="90">If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.</s>
 <s id="91">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="92">(Applause)</s>
