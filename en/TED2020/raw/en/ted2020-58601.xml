 <s id="1">London, 1928: a group of mold spores surf a breeze through a lab.</s>
 <s id="2">They drift onto a petri dish, and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution.</s>
 <s id="3">This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist investigating the properties of infectious bacteria.</s>
 <s id="4">At this time, Fleming is away on vacation.</s>
 <s id="5">When he returns, he finds a colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator.</s>
 <s id="6">And around this colony of mold is a zone completely and unexpectedly clear of bacteria.</s>
 <s id="7">In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold was secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">The mold was a species in the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed the antibacterial compound “penicillin.”</s>
  <s id="8.2">What Fleming stumbled upon was a microbial defense system.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">The penicillium mold constantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies that might consume its resources.</s>
 <s id="10">Penicillin destroys many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis of their cell walls.</s>
 <s id="11">These walls get their strength from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being broken down and rebuilt.</s>
 <s id="12">Penicillin binds to one of the compounds that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being reconstructed at a critical phase.</s>
 <s id="13">Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates the release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage.</s>
 <s id="14">Eventually, the cell’s structure breaks down completely.</s>
 <s id="15">This two-pronged attack is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, our bodies, or elsewhere.</s>
 <s id="16">It’s not, however, harmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls.</s>
 <s id="17">For a decade or so after Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained a laboratory curiosity.</s>
 <s id="18">But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities.</s>
 <s id="19">They then went on to win the Nobel Prize for their work.</s>
 <s id="20">Teams at Oxford and several American drug companies continued development, and within a few years it was commercially available.</s>
 <s id="21">Penicillin and similar compounds quickly transformed the treatment of infections.</s>
 <s id="22">For the time being, they remain some of the most important, life-saving antibiotics used in medicine.</s>
 <s id="23">However, the more we use any antibiotic, the more bacteria evolve resistance to it.</s>
 <s id="24">In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis.</s>
 <s id="25">As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria have evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number of bacterial infections.</s>
 <s id="26">This means it’s essential that doctors not overprescribe the drug.</s>
 <s id="27">Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported drug allergy.</s>
 <s id="28">However, the vast majority— over 90%— of people who think they’re allergic to penicillin actually are not.</s>
 <s id="29">Why the misperception?</s>
 <s id="30">Many patients acquire the allergy label as children, when a rash appears after they’re treated for an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs.</s>
 <s id="31">The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection and the antibiotic.</s>
 <s id="32">However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems mistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely and can be very dangerous.</s>
 <s id="33">So if you think you’re allergic but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist.</s>
 <s id="34">They’ll complete an evaluation that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy.</s>
 <s id="35">Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug may lose their ability to recognize it.</s>
 <s id="36">In fact, about 80% of people who are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy within ten years.</s>
 <s id="37">This is great news for people who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, as it has done for so many others.</s>
