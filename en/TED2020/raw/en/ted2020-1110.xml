 <s id="1">I wanted to be a rock star.</s>
 <s id="2">I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.</s>
 <s id="3">To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.</s>
 <s id="4">This was in the late '80s.</s>
 <s id="5">And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.</s>
 <s id="6">They wouldn't have me.</s>
 <s id="7">I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.</s>
 <s id="8">And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.</s>
 <s id="9">And I was certain that's what my life would be.</s>
 <s id="10">And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas when I was 18, I was stunned to find that there was not a Pop Star 101, or even a degree program for that interest.</s>
 <s id="11">And the choir conductor there knew that I sang and invited me to come and join the choir.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that.</s>
  <s id="12.2">It sounds great."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">And I left the room and said, "No way."</s>
 <s id="14">The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky, and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.</s>
 <s id="15">And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said, "Listen, you've got to join choir.</s>
 <s id="16">At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico, all expenses paid.</s>
 <s id="17">And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."</s>
 <s id="18">And so I figured for Mexico and babes, I could do just about anything.</s>
 <s id="19">And I went to my first day in choir, and I sat down with the basses and sort of looked over my shoulder to see what they were doing.</s>
 <s id="20">They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat, and boom, they launched into the Kyrie from the "Requiem" by Mozart.</s>
 <s id="21">In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.</s>
 <s id="22">The most transformative experience I've ever had -- in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing, people together, the shared vision.</s>
 <s id="23">And I felt for the first time in my life that I was part of something bigger than myself.</s>
 <s id="24">And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.</s>
 <s id="25">I decided to write a piece for choir a couple of years later as a gift to this conductor who had changed my life.</s>
 <s id="26">I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.</s>
 <s id="27">And that piece was published, and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.</s>
 <s id="28">And then I started conducting, and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.</s>
 <s id="29">And I find myself now in the unlikely position of standing in front of all of you as a professional classical composer and conductor.</s>
 <s id="30">Well a couple of years ago, a friend of mine emailed me a link, a YouTube link, and said, "You have got to see this."</s>
 <s id="31">And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me, singing the soprano line to a piece of mine called "Sleep."</s>
 <s id="32">(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.</s>
 <s id="33">My name is Britlin Losee, and this is a video that I'd like to make for you.</s>
 <s id="34">Here's me singing "Sleep."</s>
 <s id="35">I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.</s>
 <s id="36">♫ If there are noises ♫ ♫ in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre: I was thunderstruck.</s>
 <s id="37">Britlin was so innocent and so sweet, and her voice was so pure.</s>
 <s id="38">And I even loved seeing behind her; I could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room.</s>
 <s id="39">Such an intimate video.</s>
 <s id="40">And I had this idea: if I could get 50 people to all do this same thing, sing their parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- wherever they were in the world, post their videos to YouTube, we could cut it all together and create a virtual choir.</s>
 <s id="41">So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."</s>
 <s id="42">I actually wrote, "OMG," hopefully for the last time in public ever.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) And I sent out this call to singers.</s>
 <s id="44">And I made free the download of the music to a piece that I had written in the year 2000 called "Lux Aurumque," which means "light and gold."</s>
 <s id="45">And lo and behold, people started uploading their videos.</s>
 <s id="46">Now I should say, before that, what I did is I posted a conductor track of myself conducting.</s>
 <s id="47">And it's in complete silence when I filmed it, because I was only hearing the music in my head, imagining the choir that would one day come to be.</s>
 <s id="48">Afterwards, I played a piano track underneath so that the singers would have something to listen to.</s>
 <s id="49">And then as the videos started to come in ...</s>
 <s id="50">(Singing) This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.</s>
 <s id="51">(Singing) This is Evangelina Etienne (Singing) from Massachusetts.</s>
 <s id="52">(Singing) Stephen Hanson from Sweden.</s>
 <s id="53">(Singing) This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.</s>
 <s id="54">(Singing) There was even a little soprano solo in the piece, and so I had auditions.</s>
 <s id="55">And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.</s>
 <s id="56">I was told later, and also by lots of singers who were involved in this, that they sometimes recorded 50 or 60 different takes until they got just the right take -- they uploaded it.</s>
 <s id="57">Here's our winner of the soprano solo.</s>
 <s id="58">This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.</s>
 <s id="59">(Singing) I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like, "No problem, everything's fine."</s>
 <s id="60">(Laughter) And from the crowd emerged this young man, Scott Haines.</s>
 <s id="61">And he said, "Listen, this is the project I've been looking for my whole life.</s>
 <s id="62">I'd like to be the person to edit this all together."</s>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">I said, "Thank you, Scott.</s>
  <s id="63.2">I'm so glad that you found me."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="64">And Scott aggregated all of the videos.</s>
 <s id="65">He scrubbed the audio.</s>
 <s id="66">He made sure that everything lined up.</s>
 <s id="67">And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.</s>
 <s id="68">This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.</s>
 <s id="69">(Singing) I'll stop it there in the interest of time.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
  <s id="70.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="71">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">So there's more.</s>
  <s id="72.2">There's more.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">Thank you so much.</s>
 <s id="74">And I had the same reaction you did.</s>
 <s id="75">I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.</s>
 <s id="76">I just couldn't believe the poetry of all of it -- these souls all on their own desert island, sending electronic messages in bottles to each other.</s>
 <s id="77">And the video went viral.</s>
 <s id="78">We had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it.</s>
 <s id="79">And because of that, then a lot of singers started saying, "All right, what's Virtual Choir 2.0?"</s>
 <s id="80">And so I decided for Virtual Choir 2.0 that I would choose the same piece that Britlin was singing, "Sleep," which is another work that I wrote in the year 2000 -- poetry by my dear friend Charles Anthony Silvestri.</s>
 <s id="81">And again, I posted a conductor video, and we started accepting submissions.</s>
 <s id="82">This time we got some more mature members.</s>
 <s id="83">(Singing) And some younger members.</s>
 <p id="p84">
  <s id="84.1">(Video) Soprano: ♫ Upon my pillow ♫ ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: That's Georgie from England.</s>
  <s id="84.2">She's only nine.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="85">Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?</s>
 <s id="86">Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts.</s>
 <s id="87">This is Beau Awtin.</s>
 <s id="88">(Video) Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.</s>
 <s id="89">And there were 900 people involved in that.</s>
 <s id="90">So I told the singers, "That's our goal.</s>
 <s id="91">That's the number for us to beat."</s>
 <s id="92">And we just closed submissions January 10th, and our final tally was 2,051 videos from 58 different countries.</s>
 <s id="93">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="94">(Applause) From Malta, Madagascar, Thailand, Vietnam, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand.</s>
 <s id="95">And we also put a page on Facebook for the singers to upload their testimonials, what it was like for them, their experience singing it.</s>
 <s id="96">And I've just chosen a few of them here.</s>
 <s id="97">"My sister and I used to sing in choirs together constantly.</s>
 <s id="98">Now she's an airman in the air force constantly traveling.</s>
 <s id="99">It's so wonderful to sing together again!"</s>
 <s id="100">I love the idea that she's singing with her sister.</s>
 <s id="101">"Aside from the beautiful music, it's great just to know I'm part of a worldwide community of people I never met before, but who are connected anyway."</s>
 <s id="102">And my personal favorite, "When I told my husband that I was going to be a part of this, he told me that I did not have the voice for it."</s>
 <s id="103">Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.</s>
 <s id="104">Me too.</s>
 <s id="105">"It hurt so much, and I shed some tears, but something inside of me wanted to do this despite his words.</s>
 <s id="106">It is a dream come true to be part of this choir, as I've never been part of one.</s>
 <s id="107">When I placed a marker on the Google Earth Map, I had to go with the nearest city, which is about 400 miles away from where I live.</s>
 <s id="108">As I am in the Great Alaskan Bush, satellite is my connection to the world."</s>
 <s id="109">So two things struck me deeply about this.</s>
 <s id="110">The first is that human beings will go to any lengths necessary to find and connect with each other.</s>
 <s id="111">It doesn't matter the technology.</s>
 <s id="112">And the second is that people seem to be experiencing an actual connection.</s>
 <s id="113">It wasn't a virtual choir.</s>
 <s id="114">There are people now online that are friends; they've never met.</s>
 <s id="115">But, I know myself too, I feel this virtual esprit de corps, if you will, with all of them.</s>
 <s id="116">I feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family.</s>
 <s id="117">What I'd like to close with then today is the first look at "Sleep" by Virtual Choir 2.0.</s>
 <s id="118">This will be a premiere today.</s>
 <s id="119">We're not finished with the video yet.</s>
 <s id="120">You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious.</s>
 <s id="121">But we do have the first three minutes.</s>
 <s id="122">And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.</s>
 <s id="123">You're the very first people to see this.</s>
 <s id="124">This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.</s>
 <p id="p125">
  <s id="125.1">(Video) Virtual Choir: ♫ The evening hangs ♫ ♫ beneath the moon ♫ ♫ A silver thread on darkened dune ♫ ♫ With closing eyes and resting head ♫ ♫ I know that sleep is coming soon ♫ ♫ Upon my pillow, ♫ ♫ safe in bed, ♫ ♫ a thousand pictures fill my head ♫ ♫ I cannot sleep ♫ ♫ my mind's aflight ♫ ♫ and yet my limbs seem made of lead ♫ ♫ If there are noises in the night ♫ Eric Whitacre: Thank you very, very much.</s>
  <s id="125.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p126">
  <s id="126.1">(Applause) Thank you very much.</s>
  <s id="126.2">Thank you.</s>
  <s id="126.3">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="127">(Applause)</s>
