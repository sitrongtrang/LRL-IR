 <s id="1">When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room.</s>
 <s id="2">But in psychology, learning means something else.</s>
 <s id="3">To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience.</s>
 <s id="4">Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning.</s>
 <s id="5">Let's talk about classical conditioning first.</s>
 <s id="6">In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs.</s>
 <s id="7">He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time.</s>
 <s id="8">After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food.</s>
 <s id="9">They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed.</s>
 <s id="10">Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate.</s>
 <s id="11">They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell.</s>
 <s id="12">You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate.</s>
 <s id="13">We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response.</s>
 <s id="14">Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak.</s>
 <s id="15">However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus.</s>
 <s id="16">And so classical conditioning was discovered.</s>
 <s id="17">We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans?</s>
 <s id="18">In exactly the same way.</s>
 <s id="19">Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot.</s>
 <s id="20">She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had.</s>
 <s id="21">A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up.</s>
 <s id="22">He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit."</s>
 <s id="23">Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room.</s>
 <s id="24">When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there.</s>
 <s id="25">Classical conditioning in action.</s>
 <s id="26">Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior.</s>
 <s id="27">So how does operant conditioning work?</s>
 <s id="28">There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment.</s>
 <s id="29">Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely.</s>
 <s id="30">Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad.</s>
 <s id="31">Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam.</s>
 <s id="32">Let's look at an example of operant conditioning.</s>
 <s id="33">After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes.</s>
 <s id="34">When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me."</s>
 <s id="35">In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes.</s>
 <s id="36">Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives.</s>
 <s id="37">There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning.</s>
 <s id="38">We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations.</s>
 <s id="39">One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs.</s>
 <s id="40">Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso.</s>
 <s id="41">When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists.</s>
 <s id="42">Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.</s>
