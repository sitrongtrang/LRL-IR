 <s id="1">Hello everyone.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm Sam, and I just turned 17.</s>
 <s id="3">A few years ago, before my freshman year in High School, I wanted to play snare drum in the Foxboro High School Marching Band, and it was a dream that I just had to accomplish.</s>
 <s id="4">But each snare drum and harness weighed about 40 pounds each, and I have a disease called Progeria.</s>
 <s id="5">So just to give you an idea, I weigh only about 50 pounds.</s>
 <s id="6">So, logistically, I really couldn't carry a regular sized snare drum, and because of this the band director assigned me to play pit percussion during the halftime show.</s>
 <s id="7">Now pit percussion was fun.</s>
 <s id="8">It involved some really cool auxiliary percussion instruments, like the bongos, timpani, and timbales, and cowbell.</s>
 <s id="9">So it was fun, but it involved no marching, and I was just so devastated.</s>
 <s id="10">However, nothing was going to stop me from playing snare drum with the marching band in the halftime show.</s>
 <s id="11">So my family and I worked with an engineer to design a snare drum harness that would be lighter, and easier for me to carry.</s>
 <s id="12">So after continuous work, we made a snare drum apparatus that weighs only about 6 pounds.</s>
 <s id="13">(Applause) I just want to give you some more information about Progeria.</s>
 <s id="14">It affects only about 350 kids today, worldwide.</s>
 <s id="15">So it's pretty rare, and the effects of Progeria include: tight skin, lack of weight gain, stunted growth, and heart disease.</s>
 <s id="16">Last year my Mom and her team of scientists published the first successful Progeria Treatment Study, and because of this I was interviewed on NPR, and John Hamilton asked me the question: "What is the most important thing that people should know about you?"</s>
 <s id="17">And my answer was simply that I have a very happy life.</s>
 <s id="18">(Applause) So even though there are many obstacles in my life, with a lot of them being created by Progeria, I don't want people to feel bad for me.</s>
 <s id="19">I don't think about these obstacles all the time, and I'm able to overcome most of them anyway.</s>
 <s id="20">So I’m here today, to share with you my philosophy for a happy life.</s>
 <s id="21">So, for me, there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.</s>
 <s id="22">So this is a quote from the famous Ferris Bueller.</s>
 <s id="23">The first aspect to my philosophy is that I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do because there is so much I can do.</s>
 <s id="24">Now people sometimes ask me questions like, "Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?" or "What daily challenges of Progeria do you face?"</s>
 <s id="25">And I’d like to say that, even though I have Progeria, most of my time is spent thinking about things that have nothing to do with Progeria at all.</s>
 <s id="26">Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore the negative aspects of these obstacles.</s>
 <s id="27">When I can’t do something like run a long distance, or go on an intense roller coaster, I know what I’m missing out on.</s>
 <s id="28">But instead, I choose to focus on the activities that I can do through things that I’m passionate about, like scouting, or music, or comic books, or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.</s>
 <s id="29">Yeah, so -- (Laughter) However, sometimes I need to find a different way to do something by making adjustments, and I want to put those things in the "can do" category.</s>
 <s id="30">Kind of like you saw with the drum earlier.</s>
 <s id="31">So here’s a clip with me playing Spider-Man with the Foxboro High School Marching Band at halftime a couple of years ago.</s>
 <s id="32">(Video) ♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫ (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="33">All right, all right, so -- That was pretty cool, and so I was able to accomplish my dream of playing snare drum with the marching band, as I believe I can do for all of my dreams.</s>
 <s id="34">So hopefully, you can accomplish your dreams as well, with this outlook.</s>
 <s id="35">The next aspect to my philosophy is that I surround myself with people I want to be with, people of high quality.</s>
 <s id="36">I’m extremely lucky to have an amazing family, who have always supported me throughout my entire life.</s>
 <s id="37">And I’m also really fortunate to have a really close group of friends at school.</s>
 <s id="38">Now we’re kind of goofy, a lot of us are band geeks, but we really enjoy each other’s company, and we help each other out when we need to.</s>
 <s id="39">We see each other for who we are on the inside.</s>
 <s id="40">So this is us goofing off a little bit.</s>
 <s id="41">So we’re juniors in High School now, and we can now mentor younger band members, as a single collective unit.</s>
 <s id="42">What I love about being in a group like the band, is that the music that we make together, is true, is genuine, and it supersedes Progeria.</s>
 <s id="43">So I don’t have to worry about that when I’m feeling so good about making music.</s>
 <s id="44">But even having made a documentary, going on TV a couple of times, I feel like I’m at my highest point when I’m with the people that surround me every day.</s>
 <s id="45">They provide the real positive influences in my life, as I hope I can provide a positive influence in theirs as well.</s>
 <s id="46">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="47">So the bottom line here, is that I hope you appreciate and love your family, love your friends, for you guys, love you Bro’s and acknowledge your mentors, and your community, because they are a very real aspect of everyday life, they can make a truly significant, positive impact.</s>
 <s id="48">The third aspect to the philosophy is, Keep moving forward.</s>
 <s id="49">Here’s a quote by a man you may know, named Walt Disney, and it’s one of my favorite quotes.</s>
 <s id="50">I always try to have something to look forward to.</s>
 <s id="51">Something to strive for to make my life richer.</s>
 <s id="52">It doesn’t have to be big.</s>
 <s id="53">It could be anything from looking forward to the next comic book to come out, or going on a large family vacation, or hanging out with my friends, to going to the next High School football game.</s>
 <s id="54">However, all of these things keep me focused, and know that there’s a bright future ahead, and may get me through some difficult times that I may be having.</s>
 <s id="55">Now this mentality includes staying in a forward thinking state of mind.</s>
 <s id="56">I try hard not to waste energy feeling badly for myself, because when I do, I get stuck in a paradox, where there’s no room for any happiness or any other emotion.</s>
 <s id="57">Now, it’s not that I ignore when I’m feeling badly, I kind of accept it, I let it in, so that I can acknowledge it, and do what I need to do to move past it.</s>
 <s id="58">When I was younger, I wanted to be an engineer.</s>
 <s id="59">I wanted to be an inventor, who would catapult the world into a better future.</s>
 <s id="60">Maybe this came from my love of Legos, and the freedom of expression that I felt when I was building with them.</s>
 <s id="61">And this was also derived from my family and my mentors, who always make me feel whole, and good about myself.</s>
 <s id="62">Now today my ambitions have changed a little bit, I’d like to go into the field of Biology, maybe cell biology, or genetics, or biochemistry, or really anything.</s>
 <s id="63">This is a friend of mine, who I look up to, Francis Collins, the director of the NIH, and this is us at TEDMED last year, chatting away.</s>
 <s id="64">I feel that no matter what I choose to become, I believe that I can change the world.</s>
 <s id="65">And as I’m striving to change the world, I will be happy.</s>
 <s id="66">About four years ago, HBO began to film a documentary about my family and me called “Life According to Sam”.</s>
 <s id="67">That was a pretty great experience, but it was also four years ago.</s>
 <s id="68">And like anyone, my views on many things have changed, and hopefully matured, like my potential career choice.</s>
 <s id="69">However, some things have stayed the same throughout that time.</s>
 <s id="70">Like my mentality, and philosophy towards life.</s>
 <s id="71">So I would like to show you a clip of my younger self from the film, that I feel embodies that philosophy.</s>
 <s id="72">(Video) I know more about it genetically.</s>
 <s id="73">So it’s less of an embodiment now.</s>
 <s id="74">It used to be like this thing that prevents me from doing all this stuff, that causes other kids to die, that causes everybody to be stressed, and now it’s a protein that is abnormal, that weakens the structure of cells.</s>
 <s id="75">So, and it takes a burden off of me because now I don’t have to think about Progeria as an entity.</s>
 <s id="76">Okay, pretty good, huh?</s>
 <s id="77">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="78">So, as you can see I’ve been thinking this way for many years.</s>
 <s id="79">But I’d never really had to apply all of these aspects of my philosophy to the test at one time, until last January.</s>
 <s id="80">I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold, and I was in the hospital for a few days, and I was secluded from all of the aspects of my life that I felt made me, me, that kind of gave me my identity.</s>
 <s id="81">But knowing that I was going to get better, and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again, helped me to keep moving forward.</s>
 <s id="82">And sometimes I had to be brave, and it wasn’t always easy.</s>
 <s id="83">Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave isn’t supposed to be easy.</s>
 <s id="84">And for me, I feel it’s the key way to keep moving forward.</s>
 <s id="85">So, all in all, I don’t waste energy feeling bad for myself.</s>
 <s id="86">I surround myself with people that I want to be with, and I keep moving forward.</s>
 <s id="87">So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, can have a very happy life as well.</s>
 <s id="88">Oh, wait, hang on a second, one more piece of advice –- (Laughter) Never miss a party if you can help it.</s>
 <s id="89">My school’s homecoming dance is tomorrow night, and I will be there.</s>
 <s id="90">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="91">(Applause)</s>
