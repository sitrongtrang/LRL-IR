 <s id="1">It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology.</s>
 <s id="2">But now, every species in the galaxy is in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves.</s>
 <s id="3">And right away, you’ve got a problem.</s>
 <s id="4">Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel.</s>
 <s id="5">But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between there and here.</s>
 <s id="6">There’s one thing that can help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space.</s>
 <s id="7">That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick it up again later.</s>
 <s id="8">Even though your ship holds only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units in your current location.</s>
 <s id="9">With some strategic fuel caching along the way, you might be able to make it all 23 parsecs.</s>
 <s id="10">So how can you reach the alien space station?</s>
 <s id="11">Answer in 3, 2, 1.</s>
 <s id="12">It’s possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions that use more.</s>
 <s id="13">No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where to cache fuel along your route.</s>
 <s id="14">Let’s work backwards from the alien space station.</s>
 <s id="15">To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec mark with a full tank of fuel.</s>
 <s id="16">The 8-parsec point is too far from the start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later.</s>
 <s id="17">So that means you’ll need to find a cache somewhere between the start and 8.</s>
 <s id="18">But where?</s>
 <s id="19">There’s an interesting pattern that can help.</s>
 <s id="20">At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ worth of fuel.</s>
 <s id="21">At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1.</s>
 <s id="22">Is there a point, which we can call point X, where you could have exactly 2?</s>
 <s id="23">That would be useful, because then you could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity without any waste.</s>
 <s id="24">Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec cache point, and a second time for good.</s>
 <s id="25">So you’ll jump the distance between X and 8-parsecs 3 times in all.</s>
 <s id="26">You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- going back and forth.</s>
 <s id="27">Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart.</s>
 <s id="28">Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough fuel to reach the alien space station.</s>
 <s id="29">So it looks like the earliest we can place point X is at the 3-parsec mark.</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">Is it possible to transport 30 units of fuel there?</s>
  <s id="30.2">Let’s try.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">You set out with a full tank of 15 units.</s>
 <s id="32">You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, arriving with an empty tank.</s>
 <s id="33">Repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel.</s>
 <s id="34">So far so good!</s>
 <s id="35">Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump back to the 3-parsec mark.</s>
 <s id="36">You fill up your tank and jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank.</s>
 <s id="37">And now the end is in sight.</s>
 <s id="38">You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of your final destination.</s>
 <s id="39">A 15-parsec jump leaves you running on fumes, but ready to dock with the precursor space station.</s>
 <s id="40">Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone in the galaxy.</s>
