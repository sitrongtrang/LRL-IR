 <s id="1">It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation that's impossible to ignore.</s>
 <s id="2">Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom until "ahh."</s>
 <s id="3">Humans should urinate at least four to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern life forces us to clench and hold it in.</s>
 <s id="4">How bad is this habit, and how long can our bodies withstand it?</s>
 <s id="5">The answers lie in the workings of the bladder, an oval pouch that sits inside the pelvis.</s>
 <s id="6">Surrounding this structure are several other organs that together make up the whole urinary system.</s>
 <s id="7">Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra.</s>
 <s id="8">Constantly trickling down from the kidneys is the yellowish liquid known as urine.</s>
 <s id="9">The kidneys make urine from a mix of water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid into two muscular tubes called ureters.</s>
 <s id="10">These carry it downward into the hollow organ known as the bladder.</s>
 <s id="11">This organ's muscular wall is made of tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills allowing it to inflate like a balloon.</s>
 <s id="12">As the bladder gets full, the detrusor contracts.</s>
 <s id="13">The internal urethral sphincter automatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released.</s>
 <s id="14">Whooshing downwards, the fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external urethral sphincter.</s>
 <s id="15">This works like a tap.</s>
 <s id="16">When you want to delay urinating, you keep the sphincter closed.</s>
 <s id="17">When you want to release it, you can voluntarily open the flood gates.</s>
 <s id="18">But how do you sense your bladder's fullness so you know when to pee?</s>
 <s id="19">Inside the layers of detrusor muscles are millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills.</s>
 <s id="20">They send signals along your nerves to the sacral region in your spinal cord.</s>
 <s id="21">A reflex signal travels back to your bladder, making the detrusor muscle contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure so you're aware that it's filling up.</s>
 <s id="22">Simultaneously, the internal urethral sphincter opens.</s>
 <s id="23">This is called the micturition reflex.</s>
 <s id="24">The brain can counter it if it's not a good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract the external urethral sphincter.</s>
 <s id="25">With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall is stretched enough for you to sense that there's urine within.</s>
 <s id="26">At about 400 to 500 milliliters, the pressure becomes uncomfortable.</s>
 <s id="27">The bladder can go on stretching, but only to a point.</s>
 <s id="28">Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst.</s>
 <s id="29">Most people would lose bladder control before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense the need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully requiring surgery to fix.</s>
 <s id="30">But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax and the bladder to empty.</s>
 <s id="31">The external urethral sphincter is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra and bladder neck.</s>
 <s id="32">It's lucky we have these pelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage.</s>
 <s id="33">Instead, the pelvic floor muscles keep the region sealed until you're ready to go.</s>
 <s id="34">But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper physical support may over time weaken or overwork that muscular sling.</s>
 <s id="35">That can lead to an overactive pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence.</s>
 <s id="36">So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee.</s>
 <s id="37">But in the short term, at least, your body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose your moment of sweet release.</s>
