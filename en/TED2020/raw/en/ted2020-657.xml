 <s id="1">I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.</s>
 <s id="2">And by that, I mean that I develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you.</s>
 <s id="3">So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and who you are, and build a relationship with you.</s>
 <s id="4">I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.</s>
 <s id="5">So, it's a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on very small batteries, extremely lightweight.</s>
 <s id="6">The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.</s>
 <s id="7">One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.</s>
 <s id="8">There he's starting to walk.</s>
 <s id="9">This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">I built the head.</s>
  <s id="10.2">They built the body.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy.</s>
 <s id="12">We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego.</s>
 <s id="13">They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're making.</s>
 <s id="14">It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.</s>
 <s id="15">We're emulating all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine.</s>
 <s id="16">And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.</s>
 <s id="17">In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.</s>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">Okay.</s>
  <s id="18.2">So I'm smiling.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) Now I'm frowning.</s>
 <s id="20">And this is really heavily backlit.</s>
 <s id="21">Okay, here we go.</s>
 <s id="22">Oh, it's so sad.</s>
 <s id="23">Okay, so you smile, frowning.</s>
 <s id="24">So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing.</s>
  <s id="25.2">Right?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">Those machines have no place for empathy.</s>
 <s id="27">And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.</s>
 <s id="28">Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy.</s>
 <s id="29">So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for our future.</s>
 <s id="30">So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.</s>
 <s id="31">And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.</s>
 <s id="32">This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.</s>
 <s id="33">And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.</s>
 <s id="34">So, we're involving two things.</s>
 <s id="35">One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.</s>
 <s id="36">You start to believe that it's alive and aware.</s>
 <s id="37">So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"</s>
 <s id="38">which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."</s>
 <s id="39">In these stories, robots often think that they're human, and they sort of come to life.</s>
 <s id="40">So we put his writings, letters, his interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.</s>
 <s id="41">And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.</s>
 <s id="42">And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.</s>
 <s id="43">And we're getting this mass-manufactured.</s>
 <s id="44">We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.</s>
 <s id="45">Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.</s>
 <s id="46">As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.</s>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.</s>
  <s id="47.2">That's incredible.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="48">(Applause)</s>
