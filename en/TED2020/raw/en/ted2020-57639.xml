 <s id="1">At any given moment, trillions of cells are traveling through your blood vessels, sometimes circling the body in just one minute.</s>
 <s id="2">Each of these cells has its origins deep in your bones.</s>
 <s id="3">Bones might seem rock-solid, but they’re actually quite porous inside.</s>
 <s id="4">Large and small blood vessels enter through these holes.</s>
 <s id="5">And inside most of the large bones of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow.</s>
 <s id="6">Marrow contains fat and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements are blood stem cells.</s>
 <s id="7">These stem cells are constantly dividing.</s>
 <s id="8">They can differentiate into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions of new blood cells into circulation every day.</s>
 <s id="9">These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes in small capillaries in the marrow.</s>
 <s id="10">Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels and exit the bone.</s>
 <s id="11">If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance it can be traced back to the bone marrow.</s>
 <s id="12">Blood cancers often begin with genetic mutations in the stem cells.</s>
 <s id="13">The stem cells themselves are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere with the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells.</s>
 <s id="14">So for patients with advanced blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow with a donor’s.</s>
 <s id="15">Here’s how it works.</s>
 <s id="16">First, blood stem cells are extracted from the donor.</s>
 <s id="17">Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood through a machine that separates it into different components.</s>
 <s id="18">In other cases, the marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, with a needle.</s>
 <s id="19">Meanwhile, the recipient prepares for the transplant.</s>
 <s id="20">High doses of chemotherapy or radiation kill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells and blood stem cells.</s>
 <s id="21">This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely to attack the transplanted cells.</s>
 <s id="22">Then the donor cells are infused into the patient’s body through a central line.</s>
 <s id="23">They initially circulate in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them back to the marrow.</s>
 <s id="24">Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing new, healthy blood cells.</s>
 <s id="25">Just a small population of blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s worth of healthy marrow.</s>
 <s id="26">A bone marrow transplant can also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells generated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s original immune system couldn’t.</s>
 <s id="27">This phenomenon can help eradicate stubborn blood cancers.</s>
 <s id="28">But bone marrow transplants also come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease.</s>
 <s id="29">It happens when the immune system generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs.</s>
 <s id="30">This life-threatening condition occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells are collected from the blood as opposed to the bone marrow.</s>
 <s id="31">Patients may take immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed from the donated sample in order to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease.</s>
 <s id="32">But even if a patient avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system may reject the donor cells.</s>
 <s id="33">So it’s crucial to find the best match possible in the first place.</s>
 <s id="34">Key regions of the genetic code determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells.</s>
 <s id="35">If these regions are similar in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system is more likely to accept the donor cells.</s>
 <s id="36">Because these genes are inherited, the best matches are often siblings.</s>
 <s id="37">But many patients who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member.</s>
 <s id="38">Those patients turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow.</s>
 <s id="39">All it takes to be on the registry is a cheek swab to test for a genetic match.</s>
 <s id="40">And in many cases, the donation itself isn’t much more complicated than giving blood.</s>
 <s id="41">It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource that’s completely renewable.</s>
