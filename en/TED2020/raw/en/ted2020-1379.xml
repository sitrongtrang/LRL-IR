 <s id="2">And the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer.</s>
 <s id="3">And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.</s>
 <s id="4">And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes, "You see this bar?</s>
 <s id="5">I built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county.</s>
 <s id="6">Gave it more love and care than my own child.</s>

 <s id="10">I built that stone wall with my bare hands.</s>

  <s id="18.2">(Laughter) Storytelling -- (Laughter) is joke telling.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">It's knowing your punchline, your ending, knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last, is leading to a singular goal, and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings.</s>
 <s id="20">We all love stories.</s>
 <s id="21">We're born for them.</s>
 <s id="22">Stories affirm who we are.</s>
 <s id="23">We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.</s>
 <s id="24">And nothing does a greater affirmation than when we connect through stories.</s>
 <s id="25">It can cross the barriers of time, past, present and future, and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others, real and imagined.</s>
 <s id="26">The children's television host Mr. Rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love once you've heard their story."</s>
 <s id="27">And the way I like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment, which is "Make me care" -- please, emotionally, intellectually, aesthetically, just make me care.</s>
 <s id="28">We all know what it's like to not care.</s>
 <s id="29">You've gone through hundreds of TV channels, just switching channel after channel, and then suddenly you actually stop on one.</s>
 <s id="30">It's already halfway over, but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.</s>
 <s id="31">That's not by chance, that's by design.</s>
 <s id="32">So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story, how I was born for it, how I learned along the way this subject matter?</s>
 <s id="33">And to make it more interesting, we'll start from the ending and we'll go to the beginning.</s>
 <s id="34">And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story, it would go something like this: And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TED about story.</s>
 <s id="35">And the most current story lesson that I've had was completing the film I've just done this year in 2012.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">The film is "John Carter."</s>
  <s id="36.2">It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars," which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.</s>
 <s id="38">And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion with a telegram saying, "See me at once."</s>
 <s id="39">But once he gets there, he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.</s>
 <s id="40">(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.</s>
 <s id="41">Thing only opens from the inside.</s>
 <s id="42">He insisted, no embalming, no open coffin, no funeral.</s>
 <s id="43">You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us, huh?</s>
 <s id="44">Come, let's go inside.</s>
 <s id="45">AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book, is it's fundamentally making a promise.</s>
 <s id="46">It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.</s>
 <s id="47">And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.</s>
 <s id="48">You could do it an infinite amount of ways.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "</s>
  <s id="49.2">These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.</s>
 <s id="51">It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire, or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.</s>
 <s id="52">It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else, but it's going to be worth your time."</s>
 <s id="53">A well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end.</s>
 <s id="54">In 2008, I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project.</s>
 <s id="55">(Video) (Mechanical Sounds) ♫ And that is all ♫ ♫ that love's about ♫ ♫ And we'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ That it only ♫ (Laughter) AS: Storytelling without dialogue.</s>
 <s id="56">It's the purest form of cinematic storytelling.</s>
 <s id="57">It's the most inclusive approach you can take.</s>
 <s id="58">It confirmed something I really had a hunch on, is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal.</s>
 <s id="59">They just don't want to know that they're doing that.</s>
 <s id="60">That's your job as a storyteller, is to hide the fact that you're making them work for their meal.</s>
 <s id="61">We're born problem solvers.</s>
 <s id="62">We're compelled to deduce and to deduct, because that's what we do in real life.</s>
 <s id="63">It's this well-organized absence of information that draws us in.</s>
 <s id="64">There's a reason that we're all attracted to an infant or a puppy.</s>
 <s id="65">It's not just that they're damn cute; it's because they can't completely express what they're thinking and what their intentions are.</s>
 <s id="66">And it's like a magnet.</s>
 <s id="67">We can't stop ourselves from wanting to complete the sentence and fill it in.</s>
 <s id="68">I first started really understanding this storytelling device when I was writing with Bob Peterson on "Finding Nemo."</s>
 <s id="69">And we would call this the unifying theory of two plus two.</s>
 <s id="70">Make the audience put things together.</s>
 <s id="71">Don't give them four, give them two plus two.</s>
 <s id="72">The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.</s>
 <s id="73">Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.</s>
 <s id="74">It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story.</s>
 <s id="75">I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science, it's not.</s>
 <s id="76">That's what's so special about stories, they're not a widget, they aren't exact.</s>
 <s id="77">Stories are inevitable, if they're good, but they're not predictable.</s>
 <s id="78">I took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named Judith Weston.</s>
 <s id="79">And I learned a key insight to character.</s>
 <s id="80">She believed that all well-drawn characters have a spine.</s>
 <s id="81">And the idea is that the character has an inner motor, a dominant, unconscious goal that they're striving for, an itch that they can't scratch.</s>
 <s id="82">She gave a wonderful example of Michael Corleone, Al Pacino's character in "The Godfather," and that probably his spine was to please his father.</s>
 <s id="83">And it's something that always drove all his choices.</s>
 <s id="84">Even after his father died, he was still trying to scratch that itch.</s>
 <s id="85">I took to this like a duck to water.</s>
 <s id="86">Wall-E's was to find the beauty.</s>
 <s id="87">Marlin's, the father in "Finding Nemo," was to prevent harm.</s>
 <s id="88">And Woody's was to do what was best for his child.</s>
 <s id="89">And these spines don't always drive you to make the best choices.</s>
 <s id="90">Sometimes you can make some horrible choices with them.</s>
 <s id="91">I'm really blessed to be a parent, and watching my children grow, I really firmly believe that you're born with a temperament and you're wired a certain way, and you don't have any say about it, and there's no changing it.</s>
 <s id="92">All you can do is learn to recognize it and own it.</s>
 <s id="93">And some of us are born with temperaments that are positive, some are negative.</s>
 <s id="94">But a major threshold is passed when you mature enough to acknowledge what drives you and to take the wheel and steer it.</s>
 <s id="95">As parents, you're always learning who your children are.</s>
 <s id="96">They're learning who they are.</s>
 <s id="97">And you're still learning who you are.</s>
 <s id="98">So we're all learning all the time.</s>
 <s id="99">And that's why change is fundamental in story.</s>
 <s id="100">If things go static, stories die, because life is never static.</s>
 <s id="101">In 1998, I had finished writing "Toy Story" and "A Bug's Life" and I was completely hooked on screenwriting.</s>
 <s id="102">So I wanted to become much better at it and learn anything I could.</s>
 <s id="103">So I researched everything I possibly could.</s>
 <s id="104">And I finally came across this fantastic quote by a British playwright, William Archer: "Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty."</s>
 <s id="105">It's an incredibly insightful definition.</s>
 <s id="106">When you're telling a story, have you constructed anticipation?</s>
 <s id="107">In the short-term, have you made me want to know what will happen next?</s>
 <s id="108">But more importantly, have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term?</s>
 <s id="109">Have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be?</s>
 <s id="110">An example would be in "Finding Nemo," in the short tension, you were always worried, would Dory's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by Marlin.</s>
 <s id="111">But under that was this global tension of will we ever find Nemo in this huge, vast ocean?</s>
 <s id="112">In our earliest days at Pixar, before we truly understood the invisible workings of story, we were simply a group of guys just going on our gut, going on our instincts.</s>
 <s id="113">And it's interesting to see how that led us places that were actually pretty good.</s>
 <s id="114">You've got to remember that in this time of year, 1993, what was considered a successful animated picture was "The Little Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast," "Aladdin," "Lion King."</s>
 <s id="115">So when we pitched "Toy Story" to Tom Hanks for the first time, he walked in and he said, "You don't want me to sing, do you?"</s>
 <s id="116">And I thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time.</s>
 <s id="117">But we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation.</s>
 <s id="118">We didn't have any influence then, so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves.</s>
 <s id="119">And they were: No songs, no "I want" moment, no happy village, no love story.</s>
 <s id="120">And the irony is that, in the first year, our story was not working at all and Disney was panicking.</s>
 <s id="121">So they privately got advice from a famous lyricist, who I won't name, and he faxed them some suggestions.</s>
 <s id="122">And we got a hold of that fax.</s>
 <s id="123">And the fax said, there should be songs, there should be an "I want" song, there should be a happy village song, there should be a love story and there should be a villain.</s>
 <s id="124">And thank goodness we were just too young, rebellious and contrarian at the time.</s>
 <s id="125">That just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story.</s>
 <s id="126">And a year after that, we did conquer it.</s>
 <s id="127">And it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines, not hard, fast rules.</s>
 <s id="128">Another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character.</s>
 <s id="129">And we had naively thought, well Woody in "Toy Story" has to become selfless at the end, so you've got to start from someplace.</s>
 <p id="p130">
  <s id="130.1">So let's make him selfish.</s>
  <s id="130.2">And this is what you get.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="131">(Voice Over) Woody: What do you think you're doing?</s>
 <s id="132">Off the bed.</s>
 <s id="133">Hey, off the bed!</s>
 <s id="134">Mr. Potato Head: You going to make us, Woody?</s>
 <s id="135">Woody: No, he is.</s>
 <p id="p136">
  <s id="136.1">Slinky?</s>
  <s id="136.2">Slink ...</s>
  <s id="136.3">Slinky!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="137">Get up here and do your job.</s>
 <s id="138">Are you deaf?</s>
 <s id="139">I said, take care of them.</s>
 <s id="140">Slinky: I'm sorry, Woody, but I have to agree with them.</s>
 <s id="141">I don't think what you did was right.</s>
 <p id="p142">
  <s id="142.1">Woody: What?</s>
  <s id="142.2">Am I hearing correctly?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="143">You don't think I was right?</s>
 <s id="144">Who said your job was to think, Spring Wiener?</s>
 <s id="145">AS: So how do you make a selfish character likable?</s>
 <s id="146">We realized, you can make him kind, generous, funny, considerate, as long as one condition is met for him, is that he stays the top toy.</s>
 <s id="147">And that's what it really is, is that we all live life conditionally.</s>
 <s id="148">We're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along, as long as certain conditions are met.</s>
 <s id="149">After that, all bets are off.</s>
 <s id="150">And before I'd even decided to make storytelling my career, I can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story.</s>
 <s id="151">In 1986, I truly understood the notion of story having a theme.</s>
 <s id="152">And that was the year that they restored and re-released "Lawrence of Arabia."</s>
 <s id="153">And I saw that thing seven times in one month.</s>
 <s id="154">I couldn't get enough of it.</s>
 <s id="155">I could just tell there was a grand design under it -- in every shot, every scene, every line.</s>
 <s id="156">Yet, on the surface it just seemed to be depicting his historical lineage of what went on.</s>
 <p id="p157">
  <s id="157.1">Yet, there was something more being said.</s>
  <s id="157.2">What exactly was it?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="158">And it wasn't until, on one of my later viewings, that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he's walked across the Sinai Desert and he's reached the Suez Canal, and I suddenly got it.</s>
 <p id="p159">
  <s id="159.1">(Video) Boy: Hey!</s>
  <s id="159.2">Hey!</s>
  <s id="159.3">Hey!</s>
  <s id="159.4">Hey!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="160">Cyclist: Who are you?</s>
 <s id="161">Who are you?</s>
 <s id="162">AS: That was the theme: Who are you?</s>
 <s id="163">Here were all these seemingly disparate events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him, but underneath it was a constant, a guideline, a road map.</s>
 <s id="164">Everything Lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world.</s>
 <s id="165">A strong theme is always running through a well-told story.</s>
 <s id="166">When I was five, I was introduced to possibly the most major ingredient that I feel a story should have, but is rarely invoked.</s>
 <s id="167">And this is what my mother took me to when I was five.</s>
 <p id="p168">
  <s id="168.1">(Video) Thumper: Come on.</s>
  <s id="168.2">It's all right.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="169">Look.</s>
 <s id="170">The water's stiff.</s>
 <s id="171">Bambi: Yippee!</s>
 <s id="172">Thumper: Some fun, huh, Bambi?</s>
 <p id="p173">
  <s id="173.1">Come on.</s>
  <s id="173.2">Get up.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="174">Like this.</s>
 <p id="p175">
  <s id="175.1">Ha ha.</s>
  <s id="175.2">No, no, no.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="176">AS: I walked out of there wide-eyed with wonder.</s>
 <s id="177">And that's what I think the magic ingredient is, the secret sauce, is can you invoke wonder.</s>
 <s id="178">Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.</s>
 <s id="179">It can't be artificially evoked.</s>
 <s id="180">For me, there's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling -- to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder.</s>
 <s id="181">When it's tapped, the affirmation of being alive, it reaches you almost to a cellular level.</s>
 <s id="182">And when an artist does that to another artist, it's like you're compelled to pass it on.</s>
 <s id="183">It's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you, like a call to Devil's Tower.</s>
 <s id="184">Do unto others what's been done to you.</s>
 <s id="185">The best stories infuse wonder.</s>
 <s id="186">When I was four years old, I have a vivid memory of finding two pinpoint scars on my ankle and asking my dad what they were.</s>
 <s id="187">And he said I had a matching pair like that on my head, but I couldn't see them because of my hair.</s>
 <s id="188">And he explained that when I was born, I was born premature, that I came out much too early, and I wasn't fully baked; I was very, very sick.</s>
 <s id="189">And when the doctor took a look at this yellow kid with black teeth, he looked straight at my mom and said, "He's not going to live."</s>
 <s id="190">And I was in the hospital for months.</s>
 <s id="191">And many blood transfusions later, I lived, and that made me special.</s>
 <s id="192">I don't know if I really believe that.</s>
 <s id="193">I don't know if my parents really believe that, but I didn't want to prove them wrong.</s>
 <s id="194">Whatever I ended up being good at, I would strive to be worthy of the second chance I was given.</s>
 <s id="195">(Video) (Crying) Marlin: There, there, there.</s>
 <s id="196">It's okay, daddy's here.</s>
 <s id="197">Daddy's got you.</s>
 <s id="198">I promise, I will never let anything happen to you, Nemo.</s>
 <s id="199">AS: And that's the first story lesson I ever learned.</s>
 <p id="p200">
  <s id="200.1">Use what you know.</s>
  <s id="200.2">Draw from it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="201">It doesn't always mean plot or fact.</s>
 <s id="202">It means capturing a truth from your experiencing it, expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core.</s>
 <s id="203">And that's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at TEDTalk today.</s>
 <s id="204">Thank you.</s>
