 <s id="1">Welcome to Thailand.</s>
 <s id="2">Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago, the country was very, very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.</s>
 <s id="3">We decided to do something about it, but we didn't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program.</s>
 <s id="4">But we began with a family-planning program, following a very successful maternal child health activity, sets of activities.</s>
 <s id="5">So basically, no one would accept family planning if their children didn't survive.</s>
 <s id="6">So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers, and then follow up with family planning.</s>
 <s id="7">Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.</s>
 <s id="8">Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it.</s>
 <s id="9">In my country, that was the case in 1974.</s>
 <s id="10">Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.</s>
 <s id="11">There was just no future.</s>
 <s id="12">We needed to reduce the population growth rate.</s>
 <s id="13">So we said, "Let's do it."</s>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">The women said, "We agree.</s>
  <s id="14.2">We'll use pills, but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills," and we had very, very few doctors.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">We didn't take no as an answer; we took no as a question.</s>
 <s id="16">We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women, and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill.</s>
 <s id="17">That was wonderful, but it covered only 20 percent of the country.</s>
 <s id="18">What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."</s>
 <s id="19">No, we decided to do a bit more.</s>
 <s id="20">So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.</s>
 <s id="21">Actually, below that yellow sign -- I wish they hadn't wiped that, because there was "Coca-Cola" there.</s>
 <s id="22">We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.</s>
 <s id="23">And no difference, the people they chose were the people we chose.</s>
 <s id="24">They were well-known in the community, they knew that customers were always right, and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.</s>
 <s id="25">So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country, in every village of the country.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">So there we are.</s>
  <s id="26.2">We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women, selling things -- here's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people, you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.</s>
 <s id="28">And then we decided, why not get to religion because in the Philippines, the Catholic Church was pretty strong, and Thai people were Buddhist.</s>
 <s id="29">We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"</s>
 <s id="30">I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family.</s>
 <s id="31">And this picture was sent throughout the country.</s>
 <s id="32">So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.</s>
 <s id="33">And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.</s>
 <s id="34">It's been blessed."</s>
 <s id="35">That was their perception.</s>
 <s id="36">And then we went to teachers.</s>
 <s id="37">You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place.</s>
 <s id="38">So we went to the teachers.</s>
 <s id="39">Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom, I for IUD, V for vasectomy.</s>
 <s id="40">And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.</s>
 <s id="41">If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.</s>
 <s id="42">Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">Very good, mother.</s>
  <s id="43.2">Move ahead.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">Uncle buys a condom.</s>
  <s id="44.2">Very good, uncle.</s>
  <s id="44.3">Move ahead.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom.</s>
  <s id="45.2">Come back, start again."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) Again, education, class entertainment.</s>
 <s id="47">And the kids were doing it in school too.</s>
 <s id="48">We had relay races with condoms, we had children's condom-blowing championship.</s>
 <s id="49">And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend.</s>
 <s id="50">In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend.</s>
 <s id="51">We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning.</s>
 <s id="52">If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.</s>
 <s id="53">If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."</s>
 <s id="54">And that was run by them.</s>
 <s id="55">And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.</s>
 <s id="56">It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.</s>
 <s id="57">And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves.</s>
 <s id="58">And you probably hardly see a Thai man there, it's always women, women, women, women.</s>
 <s id="59">And then we thought we'd help America, because America's been helping everyone, whether they want help or not.</s>
 <s id="60">(Laughter) And this is on the Fourth of July.</s>
 <s id="61">We decided to provide vasectomy to all men, but in particular, American men to the front of the queue, right up to the Ambassador's residence during his vin d'honneur.</s>
 <s id="62">And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room.</s>
 <s id="63">(Laughter) And since it was near lunch time, they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.</s>
 <s id="64">Of course, it must be American cola.</s>
 <s id="65">You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.</s>
 <s id="66">And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."</s>
 <s id="67">And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.</s>
 <s id="68">(Laughter) And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID.</s>
 <s id="69">Obviously, he's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.</s>
 <s id="70">It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">I said, "Don't worry.</s>
  <s id="71.2">Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">(Laughter) And what happened?</s>
 <s id="73">In all this thing, from seven children to 1.5 children, population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.</s>
 <s id="74">You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing.</s>
 <s id="75">I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola, but we're good friends.</s>
 <s id="76">And so that's the case of everyone joining in.</s>
 <p id="p77">
  <s id="77.1">We didn't have a strong government.</s>
  <s id="77.2">We didn't have lots of doctors.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="78">But it's everybody's job who can change attitude and behavior.</s>
 <s id="79">Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand, and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS.</s>
 <s id="80">But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.</s>
 <s id="81">So our work wasn't affected.</s>
 <s id="82">So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."</s>
 <s id="83">So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.</s>
 <s id="84">They have more than the government, and they've got more guns than the government.</s>
 <s id="85">So I asked them, could they help us in our fight against HIV.</s>
 <p id="p86">
  <s id="86.1">And after I gave them statistics, they said, "Yes.</s>
  <s id="86.2">Okay.</s>
  <s id="86.3">You can use all the radio stations, television stations."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="87">And that's when we went onto the airwaves.</s>
 <s id="88">And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.</s>
 <s id="89">And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"</s>
 <s id="90">He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.</s>
 <s id="91">So I said, "Okay."</s>
 <s id="92">He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty-fold.</s>
 <s id="93">Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education -- everyone -- and we said the public, institutions, religious institutions, schools -- everyone was involved.</s>
 <s id="94">And here, every media person had to be trained for HIV.</s>
 <s id="95">And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money.</s>
 <s id="96">So they were happy with that.</s>
 <s id="97">And then AIDS education in all schools, starting from university.</s>
 <s id="98">And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.</s>
 <s id="99">And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys, and they were terrific.</s>
 <s id="100">And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa.</s>
 <s id="101">And then we went down one more step.</s>
 <s id="102">These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade -- going to every household in the village, every household in the whole of Thailand, giving AIDS information and a condom to every household, given by these young kids.</s>
 <s id="103">And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives, and this was a lifesaver.</s>
 <s id="104">And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."</s>
 <s id="105">So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.</s>
 <s id="106">So they all trained.</s>
 <s id="107">And then we have this Captain Condom, with his Harvard MBA, going to schools and night spots.</s>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">And they loved him.</s>
  <s id="108.2">You need a symbol of something.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="109">In every country, every program, you need a symbol, and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.</s>
 <s id="110">(Laughter) And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere, everywhere.</s>
 <s id="111">In taxis, you get condoms.</s>
 <s id="112">And also, in traffic, the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.</s>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?</s>
 <p id="p114">
  <s id="114.1">Of course I can.</s>
  <s id="114.2">And they'd enjoy it immensely; I see them standing around right now, everywhere.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="115">Imagine if they had condoms, giving out to all sorts of people.</s>
 <s id="116">And then, new change, we had hair bands, clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season.</s>
 <s id="117">(Laughter) And these were the condoms that we introduced.</s>
 <s id="118">One says, "Weapon of mass protection."</s>
 <s id="119">We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction, but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.</s>
 <s id="120">And then it says here, with the American flag, "Don't leave home without it."</s>
 <s id="121">But I have some to give out afterward.</s>
 <s id="122">But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized, so be very careful.</s>
 <s id="123">(Laughter) And so you can see that condoms can do so many things.</s>
 <s id="124">Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.</s>
 <s id="125">Stop global warming; use condoms.</s>
 <s id="126">And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection.</s>
 <s id="127">And let the next Olympics save some lives.</s>
 <s id="128">Why just run around?</s>
 <s id="129">(Laughter) And then finally, in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God, so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."</s>
 <s id="130">(Laughter) So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people.</s>
 <s id="131">We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools, because alcohol impairs judgment.</s>
 <s id="132">And then what happened?</s>
 <s id="133">After all this time, everybody joined in.</s>
 <s id="134">According to the U.N., new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent, and according to the World Bank, 7.7 million lives were saved.</s>
 <s id="135">Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.</s>
 <s id="136">So it just showed you, you could do something about it.</s>
 <s id="137">90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.</s>
 <s id="138">There was political commitment, some financial commitment, and everybody joined in the fight.</s>
 <s id="139">So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.</s>
 <s id="140">We all need to help.</s>
 <s id="141">And then we decided to help people out of poverty, now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time, not with government alone, but in cooperation with the business community.</s>
 <s id="142">Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit.</s>
 <s id="143">Those are the things to be provided by the business community.</s>
 <s id="144">We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs, little business people.</s>
 <s id="145">The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.</s>
 <s id="146">So, that was done.</s>
 <s id="147">The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting.</s>
 <s id="148">It's not a free gift.</s>
 <s id="149">They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund, which we call the Village Development Bank.</s>
 <s id="150">Everybody joins in, and they feel they own the bank, because they have brought the money in.</s>
 <s id="151">And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.</s>
 <s id="152">And we believe if you want to help the poor, those who are living in poverty, access to credit must be a human right.</s>
 <s id="153">Access to credit must be a human right.</s>
 <s id="154">Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.</s>
 <s id="155">And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.</s>
 <s id="156">Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA," teaching people how to do business so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.</s>
 <s id="157">These are some of the businesses: mushrooms, crabs, vegetables, trees, fruits, and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits; this is a village sponsored by Nike.</s>
 <s id="158">They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.</s>
 <s id="159">Make these better, because we can afford them."</s>
 <s id="160">And then we have silk, Thai silk.</s>
 <s id="161">Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left, to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.</s>
 <s id="162">So anyone sitting in and watching TV, get in touch with me.</s>
 <s id="163">And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- "Coffee and Condoms."</s>
 <s id="164">See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.</s>
 <s id="165">That's the difference.</s>
 <s id="166">Can you imagine, at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms?</s>
 <s id="167">You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.</s>
 <s id="168">And then now, finally in education, we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.</s>
 <s id="169">We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.</s>
 <s id="170">And it's a center, a focal point for economic and social development.</s>
 <s id="171">Re-do the school, make it serve the community needs.</s>
 <s id="172">And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo.</s>
 <s id="173">This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.</s>
 <s id="174">And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome.</s>
 <s id="175">And we use vegetables around the school ground, so they raise their own vegetables.</s>
 <s id="176">And then, finally, I firmly believe, if we want the MDGs to work -- the Millennium Development Goals -- we need to add family planning to it.</s>
 <s id="177">Of course, child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it's underutilized.</s>
 <s id="178">So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.</s>
 <s id="179">And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives.</s>
 <s id="180">And then, finally, that is our network.</s>
 <s id="181">And these are our Thai tulips.</s>
 <s id="182">(Laughter) Thank you very much indeed.</s>
 <s id="183">(Applause)</s>
