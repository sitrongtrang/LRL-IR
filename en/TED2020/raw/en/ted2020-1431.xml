 <s id="1">Five hundred seventy-one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by Americans every year.</s>
 <s id="2">If we could -- correction, wrong figure -- 13 billion used every year.</s>
 <s id="3">If we could reduce the usage of paper towels, one paper towel per person per day, 571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.</s>
 <s id="4">We can do that.</s>
 <s id="5">Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">There's the tri-fold.</s>
  <s id="6.2">People typically take two or three.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.</s>
 <s id="8">People go one, two, three, four, tear.</s>
 <s id="9">This much, right?</s>
 <s id="10">There's the one that cuts itself.</s>
 <s id="11">People go, one, two, three, four.</s>
 <s id="12">Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper, you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.</s>
 <s id="13">The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.</s>
 <s id="14">The key, two words: This half of the room, your word is "shake."</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">Let's hear it.</s>
  <s id="15.2">Shake.</s>
  <s id="15.3">Louder.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">Audience: Shake.</s>
 <s id="17">Joe Smith: Your word is "fold."</s>
 <s id="18">Audience: Fold.</s>
 <s id="19">JS: Again.</s>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">Audience: Fold.</s>
  <s id="20.2">JS: Really loud.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">Audience: Shake.</s>
  <s id="21.2">Fold.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">JS: OK.</s>
  <s id="22.2">Wet hands.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Why 12?</s>
  <s id="24.2">Twelve apostles, twelve tribes, twelve zodiac signs, twelve months.</s>
  <s id="24.3">The one I like the best: It's the biggest number with one syllable.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">(Laughter) Tri-fold.</s>
  <s id="25.2">Fold ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">Dry.</s>
 <s id="27">(Applause) Audience: Shake.</s>
 <s id="28">Fold.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">JS: Cuts itself.</s>
  <s id="29.2">Fold.</s>
  <s id="29.3">The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">(Laughter) Audience: Shake.</s>
  <s id="31.2">Fold.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">JS: Cuts itself.</s>
 <s id="33">You know the funny thing is, I get my hands drier than people do with three or four, because they can't get in between the cracks.</s>
 <s id="34">If you think this isn't as good...</s>
 <p id="p35">
  <s id="35.1">Audience: Shake.</s>
  <s id="35.2">Fold.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="36">JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention, it's the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out.</s>
 <s id="37">It's way too big a towel.</s>
 <s id="38">Let me tell you a secret.</s>
 <s id="39">If you're really quick, if you're really quick -- and I can prove this -- this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">How?</s>
  <s id="40.2">As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="41">It's smart enough to stop.</s>
 <s id="42">And you get half a towel.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">Audience: Shake.</s>
  <s id="43.2">Fold.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">JS: Now, let's all say it together.</s>
  <s id="44.2">Shake.</s>
  <s id="44.3">Fold.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">You will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">And remember, one towel per person for one year -- 571,230,000 pounds of paper.</s>
  <s id="46.2">No small thing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">And next year, toilet paper.</s>
 <s id="48">(Laughter)</s>
