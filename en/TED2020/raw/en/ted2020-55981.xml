 <s id="1">After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms have come to an agreement.</s>
 <s id="2">Every five years, teams representing the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament of dragon jousting.</s>
 <s id="3">Every team will face each of the others once.</s>
 <s id="4">The kingdom whose team wins the most matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament.</s>
 <s id="5">To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted in absolute secret except for a group of wizards who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, or spells to cheat.</s>
 <s id="6">You’ve been given the extremely important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament.</s>
 <s id="7">But the opening celebrations get a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games are already underway.</s>
 <s id="8">Fortunately, no one has noticed your absence so far.</s>
 <s id="9">However, you need to get up to speed quickly; if your boss, the head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job, you’ll lose your head.</s>
 <s id="10">After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings to one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard to fill out.</s>
 <s id="11">But before he can finish, your boss walks into the tent.</s>
 <s id="12">You barely manage to hide the scorecard in time, and the wizard excuses himself.</s>
 <s id="13">Your boss chuckles.</s>
 <s id="14">“Hope you didn’t believe anything Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, even in writing.</s>
 <s id="15">Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring the tournament’s been?</s>
 <s id="16">Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with a combined score of more than five hits!</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute to review your scorecard.”</s>
  <s id="17.2">You laugh along, and when he leaves you look at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number on it is wrong.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">You’ve only got one chance to save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match?</s>
 <s id="19">Pause now to figure it out for yourself.</s>
 <s id="20">The incredible thing about this riddle is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack of correct information.</s>
 <s id="21">And that’s possible because knowing that something is false is meaningful information in its own right.</s>
 <s id="22">The first key is to realize that no team will play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams.</s>
 <s id="23">So if the elves didn’t actually play one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two and goblins played one.</s>
 <s id="24">For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams once.</s>
 <s id="25">And since goblins have only played one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins and treefolk has not occurred yet.</s>
 <s id="26">We know it’s false that the treefolk tied zero matches, which means their bout against the elves must’ve tied.</s>
 <s id="27">We also know that the elves won at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, they must have beaten the goblins.</s>
 <s id="28">But can we figure out the actual scores?</s>
 <s id="29">Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie.</s>
 <s id="30">Because no more than five total hits were scored, the final tally must’ve been 0-0, 1-1, or 2-2.</s>
 <s id="31">But the treefolk must’ve scored some hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit scored against them.</s>
 <s id="32">The only option that leaves is 2-2.</s>
 <s id="33">In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored at least one hit.</s>
 <s id="34">And the elf score must be 2 or more for them to have won the match.</s>
 <s id="35">This leaves only a few possibilities that add up to 5 or less.</s>
 <s id="36">The elves couldn’t have scored three, so that eliminates these two.</s>
 <s id="37">And their total hits scored across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too.</s>
 <s id="38">So the score must’ve been 2-1.</s>
 <s id="39">With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— and your neck.</s>
 <s id="40">Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills quickly evened the score.</s>
