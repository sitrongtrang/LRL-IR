 <s id="1">For your son’s sixth birthday, you’ve promised to get him the cutest creature in creation: the cuddly.</s>
 <s id="2">It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of the terrifying duddly or the hideous fuddly.</s>
 <s id="3">They’re all members of the Wuddly species, and the process of adopting them is deeply peculiar.</s>
 <s id="4">It takes 100 eggs to make a single animal in genus Wuddly.</s>
 <s id="5">When 100 eggs are placed together in an incubator, they undergo egg fusion, and combine in the following way.</s>
 <s id="6">Blue and purple combine to make red eggs.</s>
 <s id="7">Red and blue combine to make purple eggs, and red and purple combine to make blue eggs.</s>
 <s id="8">The most plentiful eggs pair up first, and if two piles are even, an egg comes from one of them at random.</s>
 <s id="9">They keep combining until there’s just one left.</s>
 <s id="10">If the final egg is blue, a Cuddly hatches out of it.</s>
 <s id="11">Purple eggs give you Duddlies, and Red eggs give you Fuddlies.</s>
 <s id="12">The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it.</s>
 <s id="13">23 are blue, 33 are purple, and 43 are red.</s>
 <s id="14">You can begin the process of egg fusion by adding an egg of any color to the room.</s>
 <s id="15">When all the eggs have combined into a single egg, the creature that hatches will bond with you on sight, which is why getting a Cuddly is so important.</s>
 <s id="16">After all, you made a promise to your son.</s>
 <s id="17">Which color egg should you add to the incubator to get a cuddly?</s>
 <s id="18">Pause the video to figure it out for yourself.</s>
 <s id="19">Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s easy to get mixed up with all the cuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies coming from different colored eggs.</s>
 <s id="20">If we ignore how many total eggs of each color there are, and just look at the process of egg fusion, we might notice something that will make this problem simpler.</s>
 <s id="21">When two eggs fuse, the number of eggs of each of those colors decreases by one, and the number of the third color increases by one.</s>
 <s id="22">That means they all change parity, or evenness and oddness, at the same time.</s>
 <s id="23">Right now all three piles are odd, but you get to add an egg to one color, which means that it’ll be even and the other two will be odd.</s>
 <s id="24">Whichever color you choose will always be the opposite parity of the other two piles: odd when they’re even and even when they’re odd, since every egg fusion flips each pile’s parity simultaneously.</s>
 <s id="25">We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple, and 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even.</s>
 <s id="26">That means we want the blue egg pile to be the opposite parity of the other two piles at the start as well.</s>
 <s id="27">So you add a blue egg into the room, and 99 egg fusions later, only a single blue egg remains.</s>
 <s id="28">The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make your 6-year-old as happy as can be.</s>
 <s id="29">Just be sure to follow the shopkeeper’s warning, and never feed it after midnight.</s>
