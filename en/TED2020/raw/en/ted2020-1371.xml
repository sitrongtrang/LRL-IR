  <s id="1.1">Hi.</s>
  <s id="1.2">I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">It's true.</s>
 <s id="3">So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.</s>
 <s id="4">We all want to be stars -- celebrities, singers, comedians -- and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.</s>
 <s id="5">But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world's culture.</s>
 <s id="6">Any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday.</s>
 <s id="7">But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.</s>
 <s id="8">And of that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.</s>
 <s id="9">So how does it happen?</s>
 <s id="10">Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation and unexpectedness.</s>
 <s id="11">All right, let's go.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">(Video) Bear Vasquez: Oh, my God.</s>
  <s id="12.2">Oh, my God.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">Oh, my God!</s>
 <s id="14">Wooo!</s>
 <s id="15">Ohhhhh, wowwww!</s>
 <s id="16">KA: Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park.</s>
 <s id="17">In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times.</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer.</s>
 <s id="19">But he didn't actually set out to make a viral video, Bear.</s>
 <s id="20">He just wanted to share a rainbow.</s>
 <s id="21">Because that's what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact.</s>
 <s id="23">And this video had actually been posted all the way back in January.</s>
 <s id="24">So what happened here?</s>
 <s id="25">Jimmy Kimmel actually.</s>
 <s id="26">Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become.</s>
 <s id="27">Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">(Video) Rebecca Black: ♫ It's Friday, Friday.</s>
  <s id="28.2">Gotta get down on Friday. ♫ ♫ Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. ♫ ♫ Friday, Friday.</s>
  <s id="28.3">Gettin' down on Friday. ♫ KA: So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.</s>
 <s id="30">It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.</s>
 <s id="31">This is a chart of what it looked like.</s>
 <s id="32">And similar to "Double Rainbow," it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere.</s>
 <s id="33">So what happened on this day?</s>
 <s id="34">Well it was a Friday, this is true.</s>
 <s id="35">And if you're wondering about those other spikes, those are also Fridays.</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) But what about this day, this one particular Friday?</s>
 <s id="37">Well Tosh.0 picked it up, a lot of blogs starting writing about.</s>
 <s id="38">Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter.</s>
 <s id="39">But what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience, accelerating the process.</s>
 <s id="40">And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.</s>
 <s id="41">And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.</s>
 <s id="42">Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.</s>
 <s id="44">(Music) So "Nyan Cat" is a looped animation with looped music.</s>
 <s id="45">It's this, just like this.</s>
 <s id="46">It's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year.</s>
 <s id="47">And if you think that that is weird, you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that's been viewed four million times.</s>
 <s id="48">(Laughter) Even cats were watching this video.</s>
 <s id="49">(Laughter) Cats were watching other cats watch this video.</s>
 <s id="50">(Laughter) But what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie, geeky Internet culture.</s>
 <s id="51">There were remixes.</s>
 <s id="52">(Laughter) Someone made an old timey version.</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) And then it went international.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.</s>
 <s id="55">Because we don't just enjoy now, we participate.</s>
 <s id="56">And who could have predicted any of this?</s>
 <s id="57">Who could have predicted "Double Rainbow" or Rebecca Black or "Nyan Cat?"</s>
 <s id="58">What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it?</s>
 <s id="59">In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute, only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have.</s>
 <s id="60">When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.</s>
 <s id="61">(Video) Casey Niestat: So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane, but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane.</s>
 <s id="62">(Laughter) KA: By being totally surprising and humorous, Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times.</s>
 <s id="63">And so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively.</s>
 <s id="64">And so it all brings us to one big question ...</s>
 <s id="65">(Video) Bear Vasquez: What does this mean?</s>
 <s id="66">Ohhhh.</s>
 <s id="67">(Laughter) KA: What does it mean?</s>
 <s id="68">Tastemakers, creative participating communities, complete unexpectedness, these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity.</s>
 <s id="69">I mean, as mentioned earlier, one of the biggest stars in the world right now, Justin Bieber, got his start on YouTube.</s>
 <s id="70">No one has to green-light your idea.</s>
 <s id="71">And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture.</s>
 <s id="72">And these are not characteristics of old media, and they're barely true of the media of today, but they will define the entertainment of the future.</s>
 <s id="73">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="74">(Applause)</s>
