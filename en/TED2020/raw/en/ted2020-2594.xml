 <s id="1">When Dorothy was a little girl, she was fascinated by her goldfish.</s>
 <s id="2">Her father explained to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the water.</s>
 <s id="3">Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded, "Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads."</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) In her mind, it was a fact as true as any other.</s>
 <s id="5">Fish swim backwards by wagging their heads.</s>
 <s id="6">She believed it.</s>
 <s id="7">Our lives are full of fish swimming backwards.</s>
 <s id="8">We make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic.</s>
 <s id="9">We harbor bias.</s>
 <s id="10">We know that we are right, and they are wrong.</s>
 <s id="11">We fear the worst.</s>
 <s id="12">We strive for unattainable perfection.</s>
 <s id="13">We tell ourselves what we can and cannot do.</s>
 <s id="14">In our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we don't even notice them.</s>
 <s id="15">I'm going to tell you five facts about myself.</s>
 <s id="16">One fact is not true.</s>
 <s id="17">One: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics.</s>
 <s id="18">Two: I currently run a construction company in Orlando.</s>
 <s id="19">Three: I starred on a television sitcom.</s>
 <s id="20">Four: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease.</s>
 <s id="21">Five: I served as a law clerk to two US Supreme Court justices.</s>
 <s id="22">Which fact is not true?</s>
 <s id="23">Actually, they're all true.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Yeah.</s>
  <s id="24.2">They're all true.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">(Applause) At this point, most people really only care about the television show.</s>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) I know this from experience.</s>
 <s id="27">OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class."</s>
 <s id="28">And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show, which made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy.</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness?</s>
 <s id="30">Why is that?</s>
 <s id="31">We make assumptions about so-called disabilities.</s>
 <s id="32">As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day.</s>
 <s id="33">My point today is not about my blindness, however.</s>
 <s id="34">It's about my vision.</s>
 <s id="35">Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open.</s>
 <s id="36">It taught me to spot those backwards-swimming fish that our minds create.</s>
 <s id="37">Going blind cast them into focus.</s>
 <s id="38">What does it feel like to see?</s>
 <s id="39">It's immediate and passive.</s>
 <s id="40">You open your eyes and there's the world.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">Seeing is believing.</s>
  <s id="41.2">Sight is truth.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">Right?</s>
 <s id="43">Well, that's what I thought.</s>
 <s id="44">Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated.</s>
 <s id="45">My sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions.</s>
 <s id="46">The salesperson I was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin.</s>
 <s id="47">Reaching down to wash my hands, I suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink, when my fingers felt its true shape.</s>
 <s id="48">A friend described the photograph in my hand, and only then I could see the image depicted.</s>
 <s id="49">Objects appeared, morphed and disappeared in my reality.</s>
 <s id="50">It was difficult and exhausting to see.</s>
 <s id="51">I pieced together fragmented, transitory images, consciously analyzed the clues, searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope, until I saw nothing at all.</s>
 <s id="52">I learned that what we see is not universal truth.</s>
 <s id="53">It is not objective reality.</s>
 <s id="54">What we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain.</s>
 <s id="55">Let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience.</s>
 <s id="56">Your visual cortex takes up about 30 percent of your brain.</s>
 <s id="57">That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing.</s>
 <s id="58">Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex as many as two billion pieces of information.</s>
 <s id="59">The rest of your body can send your brain only an additional billion.</s>
 <s id="60">So sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds of your brain's processing resources.</s>
 <s id="61">It's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling.</s>
 <s id="62">But make no mistake about it: sight is an illusion.</s>
 <s id="63">Here's where it gets interesting.</s>
 <s id="64">To create the experience of sight, your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world, other knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention.</s>
 <s id="65">All of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight.</s>
 <s id="66">These linkages work both ways, and usually occur subconsciously.</s>
 <s id="67">So for example, what you see impacts how you feel, and the way you feel can literally change what you see.</s>
 <s id="68">Numerous studies demonstrate this.</s>
 <s id="69">If you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video, for example, your answer will be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles.</s>
 <s id="70">A hill appears steeper if you've just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if you're wearing a heavy backpack.</s>
 <s id="71">We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.</s>
 <s id="72">What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation of the world around you.</s>
 <s id="73">You create your own reality, and you believe it.</s>
 <s id="74">I believed mine until it broke apart.</s>
 <s id="75">The deterioration of my eyes shattered the illusion.</s>
 <s id="76">You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality.</s>
 <s id="77">We create our own realities in many other ways.</s>
 <s id="78">Let's take fear as just one example.</s>
 <s id="79">Your fears distort your reality.</s>
 <s id="80">Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain.</s>
 <s id="81">Fear fills the void at all costs, passing off what you dread for what you know, offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous, substituting assumption for reason.</s>
 <s id="82">Psychologists have a great term for it: awfulizing.</s>
 <s id="83">(Laughter) Right?</s>
 <s id="84">Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.</s>
 <s id="85">Now, fear is self-realizing.</s>
 <s id="86">When you face the greatest need to look outside yourself and think critically, fear beats a retreat deep inside your mind, shrinking and distorting your view, drowning your capacity for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions.</s>
 <s id="87">When you face a compelling opportunity to take action, fear lulls you into inaction, enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves.</s>
 <s id="88">When I was diagnosed with my blinding disease, I knew blindness would ruin my life.</s>
 <s id="89">Blindness was a death sentence for my independence.</s>
 <s id="90">It was the end of achievement for me.</s>
 <s id="91">Blindness meant I would live an unremarkable life, small and sad, and likely alone.</s>
 <s id="92">I knew it.</s>
 <s id="93">This was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed it.</s>
 <s id="94">It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish in little Dorothy's mind.</s>
 <s id="95">If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived it.</s>
 <s id="96">I am certain of that.</s>
 <s id="97">So how do you live your life eyes wide open?</s>
 <s id="98">It is a learned discipline.</s>
 <p id="p99">
  <s id="99.1">It can be taught.</s>
  <s id="99.2">It can be practiced.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="100">I will summarize very briefly.</s>
 <s id="101">Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail.</s>
 <s id="102">See beyond your fears.</s>
 <s id="103">Recognize your assumptions.</s>
 <s id="104">Harness your internal strength.</s>
 <s id="105">Silence your internal critic.</s>
 <s id="106">Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success.</s>
 <s id="107">Accept your strengths and your weaknesses, and understand the difference.</s>
 <s id="108">Open your hearts to your bountiful blessings.</s>
 <s id="109">Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains -- they are your excuses, rationalizations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender.</s>
 <s id="110">They are fictions you perceive as reality.</s>
 <s id="111">Choose to see through them.</s>
 <s id="112">Choose to let them go.</s>
 <s id="113">You are the creator of your reality.</s>
 <s id="114">With that empowerment comes complete responsibility.</s>
 <s id="115">I chose to step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined.</s>
 <s id="116">I chose to build there a blessed life.</s>
 <s id="117">Far from alone, I share my beautiful life with Dorothy, my beautiful wife, with our triplets, whom we call the Tripskys, and with the latest addition to the family, sweet baby Clementine.</s>
 <s id="118">What do you fear?</s>
 <s id="119">What lies do you tell yourself?</s>
 <s id="120">How do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions?</s>
 <s id="121">What reality are you creating for yourself?</s>
 <s id="122">In your career and personal life, in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your backwards-swimming fish do you great harm.</s>
 <s id="123">They exact a toll in missed opportunities and unrealized potential, and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection.</s>
 <s id="124">I urge you to search them out.</s>
 <s id="125">Helen Keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.</s>
 <s id="126">For me, going blind was a profound blessing, because blindness gave me vision.</s>
 <s id="127">I hope you can see what I see.</s>
 <s id="128">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="129">(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question.</s>
 <s id="130">This is an audience of entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators.</s>
 <s id="131">You are a CEO of a company down in Florida, and many are probably wondering, how is it to be a blind CEO?</s>
 <s id="132">What kind of specific challenges do you have, and how do you overcome them?</s>
 <s id="133">Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became a blessing.</s>
 <s id="134">I don't get visual feedback from people.</s>
 <p id="p135">
  <s id="135.1">(Laughter) BG: What's that noise there?</s>
  <s id="135.2">IL: Yeah.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="136">So, for example, in my leadership team meetings, I don't see facial expressions or gestures.</s>
 <s id="137">I've learned to solicit a lot more verbal feedback.</s>
 <s id="138">I basically force people to tell me what they think.</s>
 <s id="139">And in this respect, it's become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company, because we communicate at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows that what they think truly matters.</s>
 <p id="p140">
  <s id="140.1">BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.</s>
  <s id="140.2">IL: Thank you, Bruno.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="141">(Applause)</s>
