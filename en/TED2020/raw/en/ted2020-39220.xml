 <s id="1">Where in the world is it easiest to get ...</s>
 <s id="2">rich?</s>
 <s id="3">That's the question I asked my professor when I studied sociology in the early 90s because he was having a lecture about social democracies, the Scandinavian welfare state, and he was a classical left-wing sociology professor, and he could not hide his enthusiasm when he talked about these egalitarian societies with no rich people and no poor people.</s>
 <s id="4">But I, on the other hand, I was writing my master's thesis about rich people.</s>
 <s id="5">When I interviewed my informants from the upper classes, they all said the same thing: "Life in Scandinavia is tough."</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) "We have to work twice as hard to earn money because we have to struggle against: high taxes, strong unions controlling the wages and a generous welfare state that makes people lazy."</s>
 <s id="7">As one rich guy told me, he said, "They call it a social security net.</s>
 <s id="8">Well, I call it a hammock."</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) And as every aspiring social scientist, I started to go native; I started to feel sympathy for these rich people.</s>
 <s id="10">And that's why I raised my hand and asked my professor, "Well, what if you don't care so much about equality?</s>
 <s id="11">What if your dream is to become rich?</s>
 <s id="12">Where in the world should I have been born to become really rich?"</s>
 <s id="13">I still remember the puzzled look on my professor's face.</s>
 <s id="14">But he answered the best he could.</s>
 <s id="15">Something like, "Well, if that's your goal in life, you should probably have been born in a society with free markets, low taxes, and minimal government intervention.</s>
 <s id="16">And he added, "If you want to become rich, you should probably not study sociology."</s>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) That was a good answer and the best guess we had back then.</s>
 <s id="18">That is until I saw that the University of Oslo professor in Economy, Karl Moene, actually had checked the facts: "Where in the world is it easiest to get rich?"</s>
 <s id="19">And before I share with you where you should go to earn money, we have to define "rich."</s>
 <s id="20">The UN talks about the poverty line.</s>
 <s id="21">You know, if you earn less than one dollar a day, maybe two dollars a day.</s>
 <s id="22">But we have to define the richness line.</s>
 <s id="23">It's a more fun line, actually.</s>
 <s id="24">And the most reliable report, when it comes to rich people, the Wealth Report, they set the richness line at individuals with net worth more than 30 million USD.</s>
 <s id="25">In the consultant jargon, these people are called UHNWI's.</s>
 <s id="26">That is Ultra High Net Worth Individuals.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">That guy, by the way, is not rich.</s>
  <s id="27.2">He is just a model.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">(Laughter) Actually, on the lower part of the model.</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) And I have saved some money by keeping the watermark there as well.</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) Smart.</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) (Applause) So, according to The Wealth Report, there are more than 170, 000 UHNWI's in the world.</s>
 <s id="32">And here is the top five list of countries with the richest people.</s>
 <s id="33">Number five: China, with more than 8,000.</s>
 <s id="34">UK, Germany, Japan, and on top, of course, the United States with more than 40,000 rich people.</s>
 <s id="35">But of course, we are not interested in the absolute numbers here.</s>
 <s id="36">We are interested in rich people per capita, per million inhabitants.</s>
 <s id="37">And if we leave out the pure tax havens, like Cyprus, and Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Monaco - where we have an artificially huge share of rich people - it turns out that we have on number 5 Denmark - with 179 rich people per one million inhabitants - Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and on top: Norway.</s>
 <s id="38">(Laughter) But where's the US?</s>
 <s id="39">On place 13.</s>
 <s id="40">So what happened to my old professor's, you know, social democracies?</s>
 <s id="41">There are no rich people there.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">But OK.</s>
  <s id="42.2">30 million dollars, that's just pocket money in a country like the US, where people can get insanely rich.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) Look at the watermark again?</s>
 <s id="44">(Laughter) So, let's raise the richness line up from 30 million dollars up to ...</s>
 <s id="45">1 billion dollars.</s>
 <s id="46">And the most reliable source here is the Forbes billionaires list.</s>
 <s id="47">And according to the Forbes, if you look at billionaires per million inhabitants.</s>
 <s id="48">Number 5, Germany: 1.2 billionaires.</s>
 <s id="49">1.2 billionaires per million inhabitants.</s>
 <s id="50">The United States 1.7, Norway 2, Sweden, and on top Iceland with 3.1 (Laughter) With a single billionaire: Thor Björgólfsson.</s>
 <s id="51">(Laughter) (Applause) He could have been a model.</s>
 <s id="52">(Laughter) But the point is, the United States: 1.7 Scandinavia taken as a whole: 2.1 And the big mystery is ...</s>
 <s id="53">How can this be?</s>
 <s id="54">How can Bernie Sanders' dream societies, these socialist paradises be such a breeding place for rich people?</s>
 <s id="55">(Laughter) That's a mystery.</s>
 <s id="56">(Laughter) There are two reasons.</s>
 <s id="57">Reason number one is free education.</s>
 <s id="58">Social democracies give free higher education to everybody, and cheap student loans, and grants.</s>
 <s id="59">That enables more people to use their talents and earn money.</s>
 <s id="60">We can see this in the social mobility numbers.</s>
 <s id="61">Imagine all fathers in a society, and we divide them into five groups based on income: from the bottom fifth up to the top fifth.</s>
 <s id="62">Then we look at their sons, and divide their income into five steps, and we see how many sons of the fathers from the bottom income end up on top.</s>
 <s id="63">How many sons go from rags to riches?</s>
 <s id="64">If it was perfect social mobility, if talents and opportunities were equally distributed, 20% from the bottom would end up on each of these five ladders.</s>
 <s id="65">So let's look at the numbers for the different countries.</s>
 <s id="66">In Denmark, they are pretty close to perfect social mobility with 14% that goes from rags to riches.</s>
 <s id="67">In Norway 12, Sweden 11, the United States 8.</s>
 <s id="68">Because of free education, there are more self-made men in Scandinavia than in the US.</s>
 <s id="69">And if we look at those sons who don't end up on top but stay at the bottom, that go from rags to rags.</s>
 <s id="70">Again, 20% would be perfect mobility.</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">In Denmark, 25% ends up at the bottom, Sweden a bit more.</s>
  <s id="71.2">Norway.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">And look at the United States.</s>
 <s id="73">This is because education in the United States is very expensive.</s>
 <s id="74">But the second and most important explanation for Scandinavia being such a breeding place for rich people is this: Have you ever noticed if you have been to the United States, when you drive around and drive through a toll plaza, there are actually people sitting there taking your money.</s>
 <s id="75">Compare that to my local toll plaza.</s>
 <s id="76">(Laughter) Just a sign with some gizmo attached to it.</s>
 <s id="77">And when you go to a supermarket in the United States, there are actually people there helping to pack your things into your bags.</s>
 <s id="78">It's very friendly and convenient compared to my local grocery store.</s>
 <s id="79">Like this.</s>
 <s id="80">(Laughter) There's nobody there.</s>
 <s id="81">(Laughter) The biggest shock I had when I went to the US for the first time, when I went to the restroom, there were actually people working there.</s>
 <s id="82">Compare that to my local public toilet.</s>
 <s id="83">(Laughter) There's not even a cleaner there; it cleans itself automatically.</s>
 <s id="84">And the reason for this difference is that Scandinavian unions are pressing up the minimum wages.</s>
 <s id="85">It's so expensive to have these people working there.</s>
 <s id="86">In Norway, tollbooth operators, supermarket packers, and a restroom janitor would earn almost three times as much as in the US.</s>
 <s id="87">And that's why we have replaced these people with machines.</s>
 <s id="88">That is why I was surprised when I saw this article in The New York Times in 2014.</s>
 <s id="89">Preparing for Chip-and-PIN Cards in the United States.</s>
 <s id="90">(Laughter) Because in the United States people are still using paper checks as a method of payment, while Scandinavian banks have made us start using Chip-and-PIN cards long ago.</s>
 <s id="91">Because the minimum wages here are so high.</s>
 <s id="92">So Scandinavian banks can't afford having people manually control the checks.</s>
 <s id="93">So Scandinavian companies, because of the unions pressing up the wages, they have to downsize and introduce new technology or else ...</s>
 <s id="94">they will go broke.</s>
 <s id="95">And new technology increases the productivity in a society, which in the long run also increases profit.</s>
 <s id="96">And on the upper end of the wage ladder, in the name of solidarity, Scandinavian unions hold back the highest salaries of the skilled workers.</s>
 <s id="97">So for example, a Norwegian senior engineer - it's my uncle, by the way.</s>
 <s id="98">(Laughter) That's why there's no watermark there.</s>
 <s id="99">(Laughter) Actually, he would look cooler with a watermark, better.</s>
 <s id="100">(Laughter) He earns, on average per year, 76,000 dollars, while his American colleague earns more than 100,000 dollars.</s>
 <s id="101">So American engineers ...</s>
 <s id="102">(Laughter) They are not only more good-looking, but they are more expensive.</s>
 <s id="103">Of course, this wage restraint on high-skilled work is good for profit.</s>
 <s id="104">So, the unions are in effect subsidizing the capitalists.</s>
 <s id="105">I wish I knew all this when I gave up a career in social science because the beauty and the irony of these findings, I think, is amazing.</s>
 <s id="106">On the one hand, you have my rich informants that complain about how hard it is to get rich in Scandinavia.</s>
 <s id="107">They had it all wrong.</s>
 <s id="108">Not only is it easier to get rich in a social democracy, but they are critical to the very institutions that have helped them get rich.</s>
 <s id="109">High taxes, which gives free education and more talent into the economy.</s>
 <s id="110">Strong unions that are helping to increase productivity, and a generous welfare state that makes the unions accept downsizing because they know that their members will be well taken care of.</s>
 <s id="111">So the unions cooperate because of the safety net.</s>
 <s id="112">So rich people are a bit like Immanuel Kant's famous bird, who thinks she could fly even faster in airless space, forgetting that it's the air itself that gives her lift.</s>
 <s id="113">On the other part of the political spectrum, when Bernie Sanders is praising Scandinavian societies, he forgets that these are not anti-rich or anti-capitalist systems.</s>
 <s id="114">Because the welfare state and the unions work in tandem with capitalist dynamics.</s>
 <s id="115">And I think that is the most important lesson here.</s>
 <s id="116">The economy is not a zero-sum game.</s>
 <s id="117">We are in this together.</s>
 <s id="118">And that is why Scandinavia is a better place to fulfill the American dream ...</s>
 <s id="119">(Laughter) than America itself.</s>
 <s id="120">Thank you so much.</s>
 <s id="121">(Applause) (Cheering)</s>
