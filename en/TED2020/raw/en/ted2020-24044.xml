 <s id="1">There is an environmental mystery afoot, and it begins with a seemingly trivial detail that reveals a disaster of global proportions.</s>
 <s id="2">One day, you notice that the honey you slather on your morning toast is more expensive.</s>
 <s id="3">Instead of switching to jam, you investigate the reason for the price hike.</s>
 <s id="4">What you find is shocking.</s>
 <s id="5">The number of domesticated honeybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate.</s>
 <s id="6">This decline appears too big to be explained by the usual causes of bee death alone: disease, parasites or starvation.</s>
 <s id="7">A typical crime scene has almost no adult bees left in the hive, except, perhaps, a lonely queen and a few other survivors.</s>
 <s id="8">It's full of untouched food stores and a brood of unborn larvae, suggesting that the adults vacated without waiting for them to hatch.</s>
 <s id="9">But what's particularly eerie is that there's no tell-tale mass of dead or dying bees nearby.</s>
 <s id="10">Either they have forgotten their way back to the hive, or they have simply disappeared.</s>
 <s id="11">These mysterious disappearances aren't new.</s>
 <s id="12">Humans have been collecting honey for centuries.</s>
 <s id="13">But it wasn't until European settlers in the 1600's introduced the subspecies, Apis mellifera, that we domesticated bees.</s>
 <s id="14">Since the 19th century, beekeepers have reported occasional mass disappearances, giving them enigmatic names like disappearing disease, spring dwindle disease and autumn collapse.</s>
 <s id="15">But when in 2006 such losses were found to affect more than half of all hives in the US, the phenomenon got a new name: colony collapse disorder.</s>
 <s id="16">The most frightening thing about this mystery isn't that we'll have to go back to using regular sugar in our tea.</s>
 <s id="17">We farm bees for their honey, but they also pollinate our crops on an industrial scale, generating over 1/3 of America's food production this way.</s>
 <s id="18">So, how can we find the culprit behind this calamity?</s>
 <s id="19">Here are three of the possible offenders.</s>
 <s id="20">Exhibit A: Pests and Disease.</s>
 <s id="21">Most infamous is the varroa mite, a minuscule red pest that not only invades colonies and feeds on bees, but also transfers pathogens that stunt bee growth and shortens their life span.</s>
 <s id="22">Exhibit B: Genetics.</s>
 <s id="23">The queen is the core of a healthy hive.</s>
 <s id="24">But nowadays, the millions of queen bees distributed in commercial hives are bred from just a few original queens, which raises the worry about a lack of genetic diversity which could weaken bees' defenses against pathogens and pests.</s>
 <s id="25">Exhibit C: Chemicals.</s>
 <s id="26">Pesticides used both on commercial beehives and agricultural crops to ward off parasites could be getting into the food and water that honeybees consume.</s>
 <s id="27">Researchers have even found that some pesticides damage the honeybees' homing abilities.</s>
 <s id="28">So we have a file full of clues but no clear leads.</s>
 <s id="29">In reality, scientists, the actual detectives on this case, face disagreement over what causes colony collapse disorder.</s>
 <s id="30">For now, we assume that several factors are the cause.</s>
 <s id="31">Honeybees aren't necessarily in danger of extinction, but fewer bees overall means less pollination and higher food costs, so it's crucial that scientists solve the case of the vanishing bees.</s>
 <s id="32">Because while having less honey might be a buzzkill, crop shortages are something that would truly sting.</s>
