 <s id="1">For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia.</s>
 <s id="2">As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from such disasters as car wrecks, house fires and also life-threatening medical emergencies.</s>
 <s id="3">I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession.</s>
 <s id="4">And 10 years ago, I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree.</s>
 <s id="5">That was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference and everything is OK.</s>
 <s id="6">The next big disaster in my city was and is the long, debilitating and lethal disaster known as opioid addiction.</s>
 <s id="7">We now call this a health epidemic, and we have replaced the name "addiction" with "substance use disorder."</s>
 <s id="8">To give you some perspective of how significant this epidemic has become, in 2017, in my county of 95,000 people, we saw 1,831 overdoses [and] 183 deaths from overdose.</s>
 <s id="9">This is the job of my firefighters, as well as other agencies, to respond to that.</s>
 <s id="10">(Coughs) Excuse me.</s>
 <s id="11">So, watching this epidemic unfold for several years, I developed some insight.</s>
 <s id="12">For this disaster, we need to redefine our job as a first responder.</s>
 <s id="13">We need to be more than just the cavalry.</s>
 <s id="14">We need to do more than just save a life.</s>
 <s id="15">We need to find ways to rebuild that life.</s>
 <s id="16">And it's going to take a lot of people to do that.</s>
 <s id="17">And that is exactly what we are trying to do in Huntington, West Virginia.</s>
 <s id="18">Now, let me give you some insight as to what we do.</s>
 <s id="19">First, this is what happens when somebody overdoses.</s>
 <s id="20">Imagine you are somebody who is suffering from the brain disorder of addiction.</s>
 <s id="21">You are fragile.</s>
 <s id="22">You're embarrassed, you're ashamed.</s>
 <s id="23">And you overdose.</s>
 <s id="24">Maybe a friend or a family member calls 911.</s>
 <s id="25">And then all of a sudden, you are awakened by five or six total strangers in uniform.</s>
 <s id="26">And they're rubbing your sternum, and they're saying, "Wake up, wake up!</s>
 <s id="27">You overdosed, you could've died."</s>
 <s id="28">Now, would you not be defensive and angry?</s>
 <s id="29">Because I know I would be.</s>
 <s id="30">And on top of that, those strangers gave you a dose of naloxone, which has sent you into withdrawals, or what is better known as "dope sickness."</s>
 <s id="31">Dope sickness makes you feel absolutely horrible.</s>
 <s id="32">Some say it's like the flu, times ten.</s>
 <s id="33">Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches.</s>
 <s id="34">So not only did we, as strangers, wake you up, but we also made you feel really sick.</s>
 <s id="35">So in turn, you, the patient, are not going to be very kind to us.</s>
 <s id="36">And you're going to refuse further medical treatment.</s>
 <s id="37">OK, well, then that's going to frustrate the heck out of us, and we're going to be mad, because you're ungrateful that we just saved your life.</s>
 <s id="38">This is not a good dynamic here.</s>
 <s id="39">What we are dealing with is a brain disorder that changes your thinking.</s>
 <s id="40">It convinces you that you don't have a problem.</s>
 <s id="41">So, this might have been not only the first time you've overdosed, it might have been the third, fourth or fifth time that we, personally, have revived you.</s>
 <s id="42">This is not a good situation.</s>
 <s id="43">Second, first responders do not receive much education on what substance use disorder is.</s>
 <s id="44">Neither does the medical community.</s>
 <s id="45">We're not trained how to deal with those suffering from substance use disorder.</s>
 <s id="46">I am trained to put out many different types of fires.</s>
 <s id="47">I am trained to save a life in the moment.</s>
 <s id="48">But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction between first responders, the health care community, social services and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.</s>
 <s id="49">Thirdly, and this hits home.</s>
 <s id="50">As a first responder, I consider myself the cavalry.</s>
 <s id="51">We're knights in shining armor.</s>
 <s id="52">We want to swoop in, do our job and leave feeling satisfied that we've made a difference in somebody's life.</s>
 <s id="53">But that just doesn't happen when we're dealing with somebody with substance use disorder.</s>
 <s id="54">We leave feeling frustrated and useless.</s>
 <s id="55">We deal with the same people over and over again, with no positive outcome.</s>
 <s id="56">And you know what?</s>
 <s id="57">At some point, I realized that it is up to us as first responders and as a community to solve this problem, to find better ways to deal with those that are suffering.</s>
 <s id="58">So what I did is I started observing more on overdoses.</s>
 <s id="59">I started talking and listening to my patients.</s>
 <s id="60">I wanted to know what led them to where they are.</s>
 <s id="61">What exactly are they experiencing?</s>
 <s id="62">What makes their situation worse?</s>
 <s id="63">What makes their situation better?</s>
 <s id="64">I began experimenting with my words and paying attention to my own actions and how it affected those of my patients.</s>
 <s id="65">The education that I have received and continue to receive on a street level in Huntington has been both eye-opening and life-changing for me.</s>
 <s id="66">So, in Huntington, West Virginia, we have come together as a community, and we are changing the way that we treat those that suffer from this horrible disease.</s>
 <s id="67">We have started many programs, and it's making a difference.</s>
 <s id="68">I'll tell you about just a few of those.</s>
 <s id="69">Last year, we started a Quick Response Team, QRT for short.</s>
 <s id="70">The team consists of a paramedic, a police officer, somebody in the recovery community and somebody in the faith community.</s>
 <s id="71">As a team, they go out and visit people who have overdosed within 72 hours of that resuscitation.</s>
 <s id="72">They talk.</s>
 <s id="73">They listen.</s>
 <s id="74">They build a rapport with that patient, and they offer them treatment options.</s>
 <s id="75">Right now, about 30 percent or up to 30 percent of those that the Quick Response Team have reached out to have accepted some form of help.</s>
 <s id="76">And the wonderful thing about this is the first responders who are involved in this team, they actually feel like they can make a difference.</s>
 <s id="77">Positive change where there wasn't any.</s>
 <s id="78">This year -- (Applause) This year, we opened a free-standing specialty clinic, called PROACT, for those suffering from substance use disorder.</s>
 <s id="79">It's a one-stop shop, if you will.</s>
 <s id="80">A patient comes in, they're immediately assessed by somebody who's an addiction specialist.</s>
 <s id="81">They work with them to provide treatment options based on their own needs, individual needs.</s>
 <s id="82">This does several things for us.</s>
 <s id="83">It gives first responders a place to either take or refer our patients who are no longer in a life-threatening situation, that have refused to go to the hospital.</s>
 <s id="84">And it also clears up the overwhelmed emergency rooms in hospitals that we have.</s>
 <s id="85">The third thing that I want to tell you about is very dear to me and very important to my team.</s>
 <s id="86">We recently started a first responders self-care program.</s>
 <s id="87">More and more ...</s>
 <s id="88">first responders are experiencing compassion fatigue and PTSD.</s>
 <s id="89">It is not uncommon for the average firefighter in Huntington to deal with or see up to five young deaths per month.</s>
 <s id="90">These are their friends, these are their classmates.</s>
 <s id="91">So this much-needed program will not only recognize their hard work, it's going to give them a voice.</s>
 <s id="92">It's going to provide them with training that will help deal with the stress that they are under.</s>
 <s id="93">And it will give them more mental-health options that they desperately need.</s>
 <s id="94">We now have yoga classes in fire stations.</s>
 <s id="95">(Laughter) (Applause) We've also provided on-duty massages, which is fabulous.</s>
 <s id="96">(Laughter) And we have some off-duty programs that we've started, like cooking classes for first responders and their significant other and pottery classes.</s>
 <s id="97">So a couple of months ago, I walked out on the apparatus floor, where I had some firefighters.</s>
 <s id="98">And half of them had had a massage, and the other half were getting ready to have a massage.</s>
 <s id="99">And I saw 10 firefighters who were bantering in a very positive, relaxed manner.</s>
 <s id="100">And I hadn't seen that in years.</s>
 <s id="101">And that relaxed state is trickling down to the community, to the citizens.</s>
 <s id="102">So a couple of weeks ago, I had a neighbor overdose.</s>
 <s id="103">Twenty-two years old.</s>
 <s id="104">So of course, I hurried down to help my firefighters and my neighbor.</s>
 <s id="105">And what I witnessed was my firefighters being supportive.</s>
 <s id="106">Talking in a non-judgmental way.</s>
 <s id="107">I watched as one of my firefighters showed the father and another family member how to provide rescue breaths, should this happen again.</s>
 <s id="108">And left him with a bag valve mask.</s>
 <s id="109">Positive change.</s>
 <s id="110">Positive change.</s>
 <s id="111">Did I happen to mention the two things that firefighters dislike the most?</s>
 <s id="112">The way things are and change.</s>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) You know, I recognize that there have been drug epidemics before.</s>
 <s id="114">And I've seen what crack can do to a community.</s>
 <s id="115">A lot of our critics think that this new compassionate response that we're doing in Huntington is because of race.</s>
 <s id="116">That because the overdoses are happening so much to the white community.</s>
 <s id="117">And I understand that criticism, because we as a country messed up.</s>
 <s id="118">And we treated black people poorly during the crack epidemic.</s>
 <s id="119">We can't forget that.</s>
 <s id="120">And we must do better.</s>
 <s id="121">But right now, what I know is people are dying.</s>
 <s id="122">And we in Huntington deal with people suffering from substance use disorder of every color and every background, on the streets, every day.</s>
 <s id="123">The job of a first responder: prevent unnecessary deaths.</s>
 <s id="124">Period.</s>
 <s id="125">So ...</s>
 <s id="126">Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse.</s>
 <s id="127">And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier.</s>
 <s id="128">One of the barriers that we have dealing with the opioid epidemic is stigma.</s>
 <s id="129">So ...</s>
 <s id="130">We in Huntington, West Virginia, are showing the rest of the country that change can happen.</s>
 <s id="131">That there is hope dealing with this epidemic.</s>
 <s id="132">Our current overdoses are down 40 percent.</s>
 <s id="133">(Applause) Currently, our overdose deaths are down 50 percent.</s>
 <s id="134">(Applause) This epidemic is far from over.</s>
 <s id="135">But each and every one of us has a part to play in this epidemic.</s>
 <s id="136">Just by listening and being kind to somebody, you have the ability to make a difference in their lives.</s>
 <s id="137">Thank you and God bless.</s>
 <s id="138">(Applause)</s>
