 <s id="1">So, what is capitalism?</s>
 <s id="2">Capitalism, fundamentally, is a series of marketplaces.</s>
 <s id="3">You can have a marketplace for lemonade, a marketplace for lemons, a marketplace for trucks that transport lemons, a marketplace that fuels those trucks, marketplaces that sell wood to build lemonade stands.</s>
 <s id="4">However, capitalism of course, as we know, is this either celebrated term or condemned term.</s>
 <s id="5">It's either revered or it's reviled.</s>
 <s id="6">And I'm here to argue that this is because capitalism, in the modern iteration, is largely misunderstood.</s>
 <s id="7">In my view, capitalism should not be thought of as an ideology, but instead should be thought of as an operating system.</s>
 <s id="8">Think of your iPhone.</s>
 <s id="9">Your iPhone merges hardware with software.</s>
 <s id="10">Apps and hardware.</s>
 <s id="11">Now think about all the hardware as the physical reality all around you, and think of the apps as entrepreneurial activity, creative energy.</s>
 <s id="12">And in-between, you have an operating system.</s>
 <s id="13">As you have advances in hardware, you have advances in software.</s>
 <s id="14">And the operating system needs to keep up.</s>
 <s id="15">It needs to be patched, it needs to be updated, new releases have to happen.</s>
 <s id="16">And all of these things have to happen symbiotically.</s>
 <s id="17">The operating system needs to keep getting more and more advanced to keep up with innovation.</s>
 <s id="18">And this is why, fundamentally, when you think about it as an operating system, it devolves the language of ideology away from what traditional defenders of capitalism think.</s>
 <s id="19">But even if you go to the constitution, you'll notice, before the founders even got to the First Amendment -- with free speech, free religion, free press, they thought about patents and copyright.</s>
 <s id="20">They talked about the government's role in promoting arts and sciences.</s>
 <s id="21">It's the reason why I could not start a search engine tomorrow called Goggle.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) Google doesn't own Gs, but I couldn't do it because there could be some confusion.</s>
 <s id="23">So even property rights have ambiguity built into them.</s>
 <s id="24">And on and on.</s>
 <s id="25">And by 1900, you have other types of property that come into being.</s>
 <s id="26">For instance, imagine that in 1900, you owned 100 acres of land someplace in the Midwest.</s>
 <s id="27">It's very easy to see where your fence ends, your neighbor's property begins.</s>
 <s id="28">Now let me ask you, where in the sky does your property end?</s>
 <s id="29">Does it end at 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet?</s>
 <s id="30">It makes no difference, because other than the novelty of a few hot-air balloons, man couldn't fly.</s>
 <s id="31">But within three years, he could.</s>
 <s id="32">Now all of a sudden, it was very much relevant whether your land ends at 1,000 feet in the sky, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet.</s>
 <s id="33">And you have to have someone arbitrate that.</s>
 <s id="34">And indeed, that's exactly what happened.</s>
 <s id="35">And five or ten years from now, when Amazon wants to deliver a package over your house to your neighbor from that UPS truck, we're going to have to decide: Does you property end at five feet, 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet?</s>
 <s id="36">Where does it end?</s>
 <s id="37">And there is no ideology that will tell you where your property ends.</s>
 <s id="38">It's an operating system.</s>
 <s id="39">And similarly, we're going to see this with automobiles.</s>
 <s id="40">A few years after the Wright brothers figured out flight, human beings started using more and more cars.</s>
 <s id="41">And all of a sudden, the regulatory system -- the operating system -- had to be patched to all of a sudden address the safety of consumers.</s>
 <s id="42">That the consumers of vehicles were presenting danger to horses, other pedestrians, trolleys, what have you.</s>
 <s id="43">And all of a sudden, the drivers of these automobiles had to have driver's licenses, eye exams, registered motor vehicles, speed limits, rules of the road, so that horses, pedestrians, could coexist with cars.</s>
 <s id="44">It had to be backwards compatible.</s>
 <s id="45">So a new invention had to basically fit advances from the past.</s>
 <s id="46">Similarly, five or ten years from now, we're going to see the same thing with self-driving cars -- coexisting with human-driven cars.</s>
 <s id="47">The reason why this is important, is in 10 years, another thing is going to happen beyond drones and self-driving cars, but you're going to see the most valuable economy in the world -- the largest economy in the world -- is going to be a country run by communists.</s>
 <s id="48">The Chinese seem to be very good at capitalism.</s>
 <s id="49">And this is going to have fundamental problems and present an identity crisis for the United States.</s>
 <s id="50">Because for a long time, free markets coincided with liberties such as free speech, free press, free religion.</s>
 <s id="51">And all of a sudden, this equation is going to be decoupled.</s>
 <s id="52">And when it gets decoupled, we might find that democracy, the multitude of voices, actually impedes capitalism because a state that does not have any pretense of limited government can very quickly mandate a regulatory framework for drones, for electric cars, for self-driving cars, for any new innovation where they feel that they can leapfrog Western societies.</s>
 <s id="53">And this is a very unique thing in the American experience.</s>
 <s id="54">And this is why it's very important to think of American capitalism as an operating system and not as an ideology.</s>
 <s id="55">Because when you think about it as an ideology, you can have good politics make for very, very bad policy.</s>
 <s id="56">That market outcomes and democratic voices and battles for votes can end up stifling progress.</s>
 <s id="57">So over the next few years, as this political cycle plays out, you're going to see American democracy rise to meet the challenges that capitalism poses and modernity poses.</s>
 <s id="58">And I ask policymakers to think about -- decoupling ideology from economics, and think about how good policy can ultimately become good politics.</s>
 <s id="59">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="60">(Applause)</s>
