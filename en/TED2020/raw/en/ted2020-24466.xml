 <s id="1">You're standing at the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch on the back of your head.</s>
 <s id="2">We've all experienced the annoyance of an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why we itch in the first place?</s>
 <s id="3">The average person experiences dozens of individual itches each day.</s>
 <s id="4">They can be triggered by all sorts of things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases.</s>
 <s id="5">And then there are the mysterious ones that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching.</s>
 <s id="6">You're scratching your head right now, aren't you?</s>
 <s id="7">Anyhow, let's take one of the most common sources: bug bites.</s>
 <s id="8">When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting.</s>
 <s id="9">That compound, which we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes our capillaries swell.</s>
 <s id="10">This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates the body's immune response to this perceived threat.</s>
 <s id="11">That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen can make your eyes puff up.</s>
 <s id="12">Histamine also activates the nerves involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch.</s>
 <s id="13">But the itchy sensation itself isn't yet fully understood.</s>
 <s id="14">In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying the mechanics of itching in mice.</s>
 <s id="15">Researchers have discovered that itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of the nerves that are associated with pain.</s>
 <s id="16">These dedicated nerves produce a molecule called natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried up the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch.</s>
 <s id="17">When we scratch, the action of our fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal that overrides the itching sensation.</s>
 <s id="18">It's almost like a distraction, which creates the sensation of relief.</s>
 <s id="19">But is there actually an evolutionary purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us?</s>
 <s id="20">The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks from the outside world.</s>
 <s id="21">Think about it.</s>
 <s id="22">Our automatic scratching response would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant.</s>
 <s id="23">This might explain why we don't feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how maddening that would be.</s>
 <s id="24">In some people, glitches in the pathways responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching that can actually harm their health.</s>
 <s id="25">One extreme example is a psychological condition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies are infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly.</s>
 <s id="26">Another phenomenon called phantom itching can occur in patients who've had amputations.</s>
 <s id="27">Because this injury has so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs that are no longer there.</s>
 <s id="28">Doctors are now finding ways to treat these itching anomalies.</s>
 <s id="29">In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect the remaining limb, which the patient scratches.</s>
 <s id="30">That creates an illusion that tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary itch has been satisfied.</s>
 <s id="31">Oddly enough, that actually works.</s>
 <s id="32">Researchers are also searching for the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases.</s>
 <s id="33">If having an unscratchable itch feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed.</s>
 <s id="34">The Italian poet wrote about a section of hell where people were punished by being left in pits to itch for all eternity.</s>
