 <s id="1">His reign marked the beginning of one of history’s greatest empires and the end of one of its first republics.</s>
 <s id="2">Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed his civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values?</s>
 <s id="3">Find out in History versus Augustus.</s>
 <s id="4">Order, order.</s>
 <s id="5">The defendant today is Gaius Octavius?</s>
 <s id="6">Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus...</s>
 <s id="7">Do we have the wrong guy?</s>
 <s id="8">No, your Honor.</s>
 <s id="9">Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, was the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar.</s>
 <s id="10">He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s adoptive son and heir.</s>
 <s id="11">And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted him additional honors.</s>
 <s id="12">You mean when he established sole authority and became emperor of Rome.</s>
 <s id="13">Is that bad?</s>
 <s id="14">Didn’t every place have some king or emperor back then?</s>
 <s id="15">Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown their kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people, not the privilege of a ruling family.</s>
 <s id="16">And it was Octavius who destroyed this tradition.</s>
 <s id="17">Octavius was a model public servant.</s>
 <s id="18">At 16, he was elected to the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship.</s>
 <s id="19">He fought for Rome in Hispania alongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility of avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate betrayed and murdered him.</s>
 <s id="20">Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant who tried to make himself a king while consorting with his Egyptian queen Cleopatra.</s>
 <s id="21">After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war that tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back to increase his own power.</s>
 <s id="22">Antony was a fool.</s>
 <s id="23">He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms for himself and Cleopatra.</s>
 <s id="24">Isn’t that what Caesar had been accused of?</s>
 <s id="25">Well...</s>
 <s id="26">So Octavius destroyed Antony for trying to become a king and then became one himself?</s>
 <s id="27">That’s right.</s>
 <s id="28">You can see the megalomania even in his adopted title – "The Illustrious One."</s>
 <s id="29">That was a religious honorific.</s>
 <s id="30">And Augustus didn’t seek power for his own sake.</s>
 <s id="31">As winner of the civil war and commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore law and order to Rome so that other factions didn’t continue fighting.</s>
 <s id="32">He didn’t restore the law - he made it subordinate to him!</s>
 <s id="33">Not true.</s>
 <s id="34">Augustus worked to restore the Senate’s prestige, improved food security for the lower classes, and relinquished control of the army when he resigned his consul post.</s>
 <s id="35">Mere optics.</s>
 <s id="36">He used his military influence and personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate military triumphs.</s>
 <s id="37">He kept control of provinces with the most legions.</s>
 <s id="38">And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position twice more to promote his grandchildren.</s>
 <s id="39">He was clearly trying to establish a dynasty.</s>
 <s id="40">But what did he do with all that power?</s>
 <s id="41">Glad you asked, your Honor.</s>
 <s id="42">Augustus’s accomplishments were almost too many to name.</s>
 <s id="43">He established consistent taxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation by local tax officials.</s>
 <s id="44">He personally financed a network of roads and employed couriers so news and troops could travel easily throughout the realm.</s>
 <s id="45">And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous public buildings were constructed.</s>
 <s id="46">The writers of the time were nearly unanimous in praising his rule.</s>
 <s id="47">Did the writers have any other choice?</s>
 <s id="48">Augustus exiled plenty of people on vague charges, including Ovid, one of Rome’s greatest poets.</s>
 <s id="49">And you forgot to mention the intrusive laws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage between social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried.</s>
 <s id="50">He was trying to improve the citizenry and instill discipline.</s>
 <s id="51">And he succeeded.</s>
 <s id="52">His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded Rome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered as a model of civic virtue.</s>
 <s id="53">His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless conquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy.</s>
 <s id="54">Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform commits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf of "the people," we have Augustus Caesar to thank.</s>
 <s id="55">So you’re saying Augustus was a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing?</s>
 <s id="56">We’re used to celebrating historical leaders for their achievements and victories.</s>
 <s id="57">But to ask whether an individual should have such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial.</s>
