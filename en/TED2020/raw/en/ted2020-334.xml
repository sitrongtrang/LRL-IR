 <s id="1">Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.</s>
 <s id="2">Can you tell everybody your name?</s>
 <s id="3">Einstein: Einstein.</s>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">SW: This is Einstein.</s>
  <s id="4.2">Can you tell everyone "hi"?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">E: Hello.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">SW: That's nice.</s>
  <s id="6.2">Can you be polite?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">E: Hi, sweetheart.</s>
 <s id="8">SW: Much better.</s>
 <s id="9">Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006, amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.</s>
 <s id="10">In fact, she's very excited.</s>
 <s id="11">E: Woo.</s>
 <s id="12">SW: Yeah.</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about all the exciting speakers here for the conference.</s>
 <s id="14">This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom O'Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday.</s>
 <s id="15">Einstein, did you hear whispers?</s>
 <s id="16">E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah.</s>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.</s>
 <s id="18">A lot of her research goes on in case, which can get pretty dusty.</s>
 <s id="19">E: Achoo!</s>
 <s id="20">SW: It could make her sneeze.</s>
 <s id="21">But more importantly, her research could help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.</s>
 <s id="22">Einstein: [Coughs] SW: Yeah.</s>
 <s id="23">(Laughter) Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes in his research at the microscopic level.</s>
 <s id="24">Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">E: Oh, my God!</s>
  <s id="25.2">My God!</s>
  <s id="25.3">My God!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">SW: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="26.2">She would get really, really excited.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) That is one big peanut.</s>
 <s id="28">Since Einstein is a bird, she's very interested in things that fly.</s>
 <s id="29">She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.</s>
 <s id="30">E: Ooh.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">SW: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="31.2">She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?</s>
 <s id="33">E: [Spaceship noise] SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">E: [Laser noise] (Laughter) SW: Yeah, yeah.</s>
  <s id="34.2">That was pretty funny, Einstein.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.</s>
 <s id="36">It would be very dangerous if you fell down.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">E: Wheeeeeee!</s>
  <s id="37.2">[Splat] SW: Yeah.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">(Laughter) Little splat at the end there.</s>
  <s id="38.2">Einstein, did that hurt?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">E: Ow, ow, ow.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">SW: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="40.2">It's all a lot of hard work.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="41.2">It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="42">E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah, it sure can.</s>
 <s id="43">But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public she loves to take in the arts.</s>
 <s id="44">If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner, Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.</s>
 <s id="45">Can you get down?</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter) SW: Let's get down for everybody.</s>
  <s id="46.2">Come on now.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">She's going to make me do it, too.</s>
  <s id="47.2">Ooh, ooh.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="48">Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</s>
 <s id="49">SW: Do your head now.</s>
 <s id="50">E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.</s>
 <s id="51">(Laughter) SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera?</s>
 <s id="52">E: [Operatic squawk] SW: Very good.</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?</s>
 <s id="54">Einstein, can you also sing?</s>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">I know, you need to get rid of that seed first.</s>
  <s id="55.2">Can you sing?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="56">E: La, la.</s>
 <s id="57">SW: There you go.</s>
 <s id="58">And, of course, if all else fails, she can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.</s>
 <s id="59">E: [Squawks] SW: All right.</s>
 <s id="60">Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier, but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.</s>
 <s id="61">E: What's the matter?</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">SW: No, I don't have a problem.</s>
  <s id="62.2">You have the problem, remember?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">You were saying that you were really embarrassed, because you're in love with a pirate?</s>
 <s id="64">E: Yar.</s>
 <p id="p65">
  <s id="65.1">SW: There we go.</s>
  <s id="65.2">And what do pirates like to drink?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="66">E: Beer.</s>
 <s id="67">SW: Yeah, that's right.</s>
 <s id="68">But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.</s>
 <s id="69">You like to drink water.</s>
 <p id="p70">
  <s id="70.1">E: [Water sound] SW: Very good.</s>
  <s id="70.2">Now, really, she is pretty nervous.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="71">Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here, and she's pretty nervous to meet him.</s>
 <s id="72">She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.</s>
 <s id="73">What do you say to a good-looking man?</s>
 <s id="74">E: Hey, baby.</s>
 <s id="75">(Laughter) SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.</s>
 <s id="76">E: Yee haw.</s>
 <s id="77">(Laughter) SW: And since she's such a big fan, she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.</s>
 <s id="78">And we didn't think he'd be in town then, so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.</s>
 <s id="79">So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.</s>
 <s id="80">Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?</s>
 <s id="81">E: Happy birthday to you.</s>
 <s id="82">SW: Again.</s>
 <s id="83">E: Happy birthday to you.</s>
 <s id="84">SW: Again.</s>
 <s id="85">E: Happy birthday to you.</s>
 <s id="86">SW: Big finish.</s>
 <s id="87">E: Happy birthday to you.</s>
 <s id="88">SW: Good job!</s>
 <s id="89">(Applause) Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.</s>
 <s id="90">Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?</s>
 <s id="91">E: Woo, woo, woo.</s>
 <s id="92">SW: What about the other birds?</s>
 <s id="93">E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.</s>
 <s id="94">SW: And the penguin?</s>
 <s id="95">E: Quack, quack, quack.</s>
 <s id="96">SW: There we go.</s>
 <p id="p97">
  <s id="97.1">(Laughter) Let's get that one out of there.</s>
  <s id="97.2">How about a chimpanzee?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p98">
  <s id="98.1">E: Ooh, ooh, ooh.</s>
  <s id="98.2">Aah, aah, aah.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="99">SW: Very good.</s>
 <s id="100">(Laughter) What about a wolf?</s>
 <s id="101">E: Ooooowww.</s>
 <s id="102">SW: And a pig?</s>
 <s id="103">E: Oink, oink, oink.</s>
 <s id="104">SW: And the rooster?</s>
 <s id="105">E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!</s>
 <s id="106">SW: And how about those cats?</s>
 <s id="107">E: Meow.</s>
 <s id="108">(Laughter) SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.</s>
 <s id="109">E: Grrrrr.</s>
 <s id="110">(Laughter) SW: What about a skunk?</s>
 <s id="111">E: Stinker.</s>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">(Laughter) SW: She's a comedian.</s>
  <s id="112.2">I suppose you think you're famous?</s>
  <s id="112.3">Are you famous?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">E: Superstar.</s>
 <p id="p114">
  <s id="114.1">SW: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="114.2">You are a superstar.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="115">(Laughter) Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in].</s>
 <s id="116">Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.</s>
 <s id="117">Why do we want to protect your home?</s>
 <s id="118">E: I'm special.</s>
 <s id="119">SW: You are very special.</s>
 <s id="120">What would you like to say to all these nice people?</s>
 <s id="121">E: I love you.</s>
 <p id="p122">
  <s id="122.1">SW: That's good.</s>
  <s id="122.2">Can you blow them a kiss?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="123">E: [Kissing noise] SW: And what do you say when it's time to go?</s>
 <s id="124">E: Goodbye.</s>
 <p id="p125">
  <s id="125.1">SW: Good job.</s>
  <s id="125.2">Thank you all.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="126">(Applause)</s>
