 <s id="1">I'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me.</s>
 <s id="2">You're a little girl of five years old.</s>
 <s id="3">Sitting in front of a mirror, you ask yourself, "Do I exist?"</s>
 <s id="4">In this space, there is very little context, and so you move into a different one, one filled with people.</s>
 <s id="5">Surely, now you know you're not a figment of your own imagination.</s>
 <s id="6">You breathe their air.</s>
 <s id="7">You see them, so they must see you.</s>
 <s id="8">And yet, you still can't help but wonder: Do I only exist when people speak to me?</s>
 <s id="9">Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?</s>
 <s id="10">But through various artworks that reflect upon our society, I came to understand how a young black girl can grow up feeling as if she's not seen, and perhaps she doesn't exist.</s>
 <s id="11">You see, if young people don't have positive images of themselves and all that remains are negative stereotypes, this affects their self-image.</s>
 <s id="12">But it also affects the way that the rest of society treats them.</s>
 <s id="13">I discovered this having lived in Cape Town for about five years at the time.</s>
 <s id="14">I felt a deep sense of dislocation and invisibility.</s>
 <s id="15">I couldn't see myself represented.</s>
 <s id="16">I couldn't see the women who've raised me, the ones who've influenced me, and the ones that have made South Africa what it is today.</s>
 <s id="17">I decided to do something about it.</s>
 <s id="18">What do you think when you see this?</s>
 <s id="19">If you were a black girl, how would it make you feel?</s>
 <s id="20">Walking down the street, what does the city you live in say to you?</s>
 <s id="21">What symbols are present?</s>
 <s id="22">Which histories are celebrated?</s>
 <s id="23">And on the other hand, which ones are omitted?</s>
 <s id="24">You see, public spaces are hardly ever as neutral as they may seem.</s>
 <s id="25">I discovered this when I made this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.</s>
 <s id="26">Cape Town is teeming with masculine architecture, monuments and statues, such as Louis Botha in that photograph.</s>
 <s id="27">This overt presence of white colonial and Afrikaner nationalist men not only echoes a social, gender and racial divide, but it also continues to affect the way that women -- and the way, particularly, black women -- see themselves in relation to dominant male figures in public spaces.</s>
 <s id="28">For this reason, among others, I don't believe that we need statues.</s>
 <s id="29">The preservation of history and the act of remembering can be achieved in more memorable and effective ways.</s>
 <s id="30">As part of a year-long public holiday series, I use performance art as a form of social commentary to draw people's attention to certain issues, as well as addressing the absence of the black female body in memorialized public spaces, especially on public holidays.</s>
 <s id="31">Women's Day was coming up.</s>
 <s id="32">I looked at what the day means -- the Women's March to the union buildings in 1956, petitioning against the pass laws.</s>
 <s id="33">Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy of how women are treated, especially in public spaces today, I decided to do something about it.</s>
 <s id="34">Headline: [Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank] How do I comment on such polar opposites?</s>
 <s id="35">In the guise of my great-grandmother, I performed bare-breasted, close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.</s>
 <s id="36">This space is also called Freedom Square, where women were a part of demonstrations against apartheid laws.</s>
 <s id="37">I was not comfortable with women being seen as only victims in society.</s>
 <s id="38">You might wonder how people reacted to this.</s>
 <s id="39">(Video) Woman: (Cheering) Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes!</s>
 <s id="40">Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?</s>
 <s id="41">(Applause) So I realized that through my performances, I've been able to make regular people reflect upon their society, looking at the past as well as the current democracy.</s>
 <s id="42">(Video) Man (offscreen): She's been there since three o'clock.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.</s>
  <s id="43.2">About an hour still?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p44">
  <s id="44.1">Man 1: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="44.2">It's just a really hot day.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="45">Man 1: It's very interesting.</s>
 <s id="46">It's very powerful.</s>
 <s id="47">I think it's cool.</s>
 <s id="48">I think a lot of people are quick to join a group that's a movement towards something, but not many people are ready to do something as an individual.</s>
 <s id="49">Man 2: So it's the individual versus the collective.</s>
 <s id="50">Man 1: Yeah.</s>
 <s id="51">So I think her pushing her own individual message in performance ...</s>
 <s id="52">it's powerful.</s>
 <s id="53">Yeah, I think it's quite powerful that she's doing it on her own.</s>
 <s id="54">I'd be interested to know why she's using hair extensions as wings, or whatever those things are meant to be.</s>
 <s id="55">They are wings, yes?</s>
 <s id="56">Woman 3: With her standing there right now, I think it's just my interpretation that we are bringing the statue down and bringing up something that's supposed to represent African pride, I think.</s>
 <s id="57">Or something like that.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">Something should stand while Rhodes falls, I think that's what it's saying.</s>
  <s id="58.2">Yeah.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">Yes.</s>
  <s id="59.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">Man 3: What is behind me represents the African culture.</s>
 <s id="61">We can't have the colonialist law, so we need to remove all these colonial statues.</s>
 <s id="62">We have have our own statues now, our African leaders -- Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah -- all those who paid their lives for our liberation.</s>
 <s id="63">We can't continue in the 21st century, and after 21 years of democracy, have the colonizers in our own country.</s>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">They belong somewhere.</s>
  <s id="64.2">Maybe in a museum; not here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">I mean learning institutions, places where young people, young minds are being shaped.</s>
 <s id="66">So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha, Rhodes, all these people, because they're representing the colonialism.</s>
 <s id="67">(Applause) Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015, the Cecil John Rhodes statue was scheduled to be removed after a month of debates for and against its removal by various stakeholders.</s>
 <s id="68">This caused a widespread interest in statues in South Africa.</s>
 <s id="69">Opinions varied, but the media focused on problematizing the removal of statues.</s>
 <s id="70">On that -- well, that year, I had just begun my master's at the University of Cape Town.</s>
 <s id="71">During the time of the debate of the statue, I had been having reoccurring dreams about a bird.</s>
 <s id="72">And so I started conjuring her mentally, spiritually and through dress.</s>
 <s id="73">On that day, I happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors, and they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day.</s>
 <s id="74">I told them that I'd explain later, but we had to postpone the meeting because I was going to perform her as the statue came down.</s>
 <s id="75">Her name was Chapungu.</s>
 <s id="76">She was a soapstone bird that was looted from Great Zimbabwe in the late 1800s, and is still currently housed in Cecil John Rhodes's estate in Cape Town.</s>
 <s id="77">On that day, I embodied her existence using my body, while standing in the blazing sun for nearly four hours.</s>
 <s id="78">As the time came, the crane came alive.</s>
 <s id="79">The people did, too -- shouting, screaming, clenching their fists and taking pictures of the moment on their phones and cameras.</s>
 <s id="80">Chapungu's wings, along with the crane, rose to declare the fall of Cecil John Rhodes.</s>
 <s id="81">(Applause) Euphoria filled the air as he became absent from his base, while she remained still, very present, half an hour after his removal.</s>
 <s id="82">Twenty-three years after apartheid, a new generation of radicals has arisen in South Africa.</s>
 <s id="83">The story of Chapungu and Rhodes in the same space and time asks important questions related to gender, power, self-representation, history making and repatriation.</s>
 <s id="84">From then on, I realized that my spiritual beliefs and dreams texture my material reality.</s>
 <s id="85">But for me, Chapungu's story felt incomplete.</s>
 <s id="86">This soapstone bird, a spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors, needed me to continue her story.</s>
 <s id="87">And so I dabbled in the dream space a little bit more, and this is how "Falling" was born.</s>
 <s id="88">[A film by Sethembile Msezane] (Video) (A capella singing) [FALLING] (Applause) In the film, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany share a common story about the soapstone birds that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.</s>
 <s id="89">After Zimbabwe gained its independence, all the birds except for one were returned to the monument.</s>
 <s id="90">"Falling" explores the mythological belief that there will be unrest until the final bird is returned.</s>
 <s id="91">Through my work, I have realized a lot about the world around me: how we move through spaces, who we choose to celebrate and who we remember.</s>
 <s id="92">Now I look in the mirror and not only see an image of myself, but of the women who have made me who I am today.</s>
 <s id="93">I stand tall in my work, celebrating women's histories, in the hope that perhaps one day, no little black girl has to ever feel like she doesn't exist.</s>
 <s id="94">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="95">(Applause)</s>
