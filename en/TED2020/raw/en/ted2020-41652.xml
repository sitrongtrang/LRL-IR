 <s id="1">For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source of protein and nutrition.</s>
 <s id="2">But recent studies show that 33% of wild fisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their maximum capacity.</s>
 <s id="3">In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild.</s>
 <s id="4">It’s grown through aquaculture, or aquatic farming.</s>
 <s id="5">Farmed seafood is one of the fastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year.</s>
 <s id="6">But different methods of aquaculture come with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems we’ve seen in industrial agriculture.</s>
 <s id="7">So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes we’ve made on land, at sea?</s>
 <s id="8">What aquaculture approaches are we currently using, and what does a sustainable way to farm the ocean really look like?</s>
 <s id="9">One of the most common aquaculture methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating cages roughly 1000 square meters in size.</s>
 <s id="10">Commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens.</s>
 <s id="11">They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases to wild species.</s>
 <s id="12">Worse still, since the antibiotics employed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back into the environment.</s>
 <s id="13">Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which compete for resources and weaken the local gene pool with genes adapted for captivity.</s>
 <s id="14">Escaped fish can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species.</s>
 <s id="15">Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems.</s>
 <s id="16">Just like net pens, these ponds are prone to spreading pollution and disease.</s>
 <s id="17">Their construction also frequently destroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons of greenhouse gases.</s>
 <s id="18">One way to solve these problems is to farm fish on land in completely contained systems.</s>
 <s id="19">Tanks and raceways can recirculate and filter water to prevent pollution.</s>
 <s id="20">But even fully contained facilities still contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal.</s>
 <s id="21">About 10% of the seafood caught globally is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish.</s>
 <s id="22">Researchers are working on fish feed made of insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms are connected to overfishing.</s>
 <s id="23">All these obstacles can make sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new ways to responsibly farm the seas.</s>
 <s id="24">The most promising solution of all may be to look lower on the food chain.</s>
 <s id="25">Instead of cramming large, carnivorous fish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish and seaweeds.</s>
 <s id="26">These low-maintenance flora and fauna don’t need to be fed at all.</s>
 <s id="27">In fact, they naturally improve water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight and nutrients in the seawater.</s>
 <s id="28">By absorbing carbon through photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other species to thrive.</s>
 <s id="29">Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for coastal communities, and support healthy plant and shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly low carbon footprint.</s>
 <s id="30">In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish.</s>
 <s id="31">With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively the size of Washington State could feed the planet.</s>
 <s id="32">Farms like these are already popping up around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future.</s>
 <s id="33">Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.</s>
