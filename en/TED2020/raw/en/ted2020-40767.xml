 <s id="1">Hello.</s>
 <s id="2">Well, I'm here to talk to you about my animal muse: the sloth.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) I've been documenting the strange lives of the world's slowest mammal for the last 10 years.</s>
 <s id="4">I still remember the first time I saw one.</s>
 <s id="5">I was fascinated by their freaky biology.</s>
 <s id="6">I mean, what's not to love about an animal that's born with a fixed grin on its face?</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) And the need to hug.</s>
 <s id="8">Audience: Awww.</s>
 <s id="9">But sloths are massively misunderstood.</s>
 <s id="10">They've been saddled with a name that speaks of sin and damned for their languorous lifestyle, which people seem to think has no place amongst the fittest in the fast-paced race for survival.</s>
 <s id="11">Well, I'm here to tell you that we've got this animal all wrong -- and how understanding the truth about the sloth may help save us and this planet we both call home.</s>
 <s id="12">I traced sloth-based slander back to a Spanish conquistador called Valdés, who gave the first description of a sloth in his encyclopedia of the New World.</s>
 <s id="13">He said the sloth was "the stupidest animal that can be found in the world ...</s>
 <s id="14">I have never seen such an ugly animal or one that is more useless."</s>
 <s id="15">(Laughter) Tell us what you really think, Valdés.</s>
 <s id="16">(Laughter) I'd like to have a word about Valdés's drawing skills.</s>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) I mean, what is that?</s>
 <s id="18">(Laughter) I've never seen an illustration of a sloth that's more useless.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) But I mean, on the plus side, he has given the sloth a remarkably humanlike face, and sloths do have remarkably humanlike faces.</s>
 <s id="20">This sloth I photographed in Costa Rica, I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) But then, sloths do bear an uncanny resemblance to the The Beatles.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) Particularly pleased with Paul, actually, on there.</s>
 <s id="23">But like The Beatles, sloths are also extremely successful.</s>
 <s id="24">They come from an ancient line of mammals, and there were once dozens of species including the giant ground sloth, which was the size of a small elephant and one of the only animals big enough to eat avocado pits whole and disperse them.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">So ...</s>
  <s id="25.2">(Laughter) Some of you have worked it out already.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) That means that without sloths, there might be no avocado on toast today, leaving hipsters everywhere totally bereft at breakfast.</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) (Applause) Today, there are six surviving species, and they fall into two groups.</s>
 <s id="28">You've got your Bradypus three-toed sloths, they're the ones with the Beatles haircuts and the Mona Lisa smiles.</s>
 <s id="29">Then, there are the two-toed sloths.</s>
 <s id="30">They look a little bit more like a cross between a Wookiee and a pig.</s>
 <s id="31">They live in the jungles of Central and South America, and they're extremely prolific.</s>
 <s id="32">There was a survey that was done in the 1970s in a Panamanian tropical forest that found that sloths were the most numerically abundant large animal.</s>
 <s id="33">They took up one quarter of the mammalian biomass.</s>
 <s id="34">Now, that's an awful lot of sloths and suggests they're doing something very right indeed.</s>
 <s id="35">So what if, rather than deriding the sloth for being different, we tried to learn from it instead?</s>
 <s id="36">We humans are obsessed with speed.</s>
 <s id="37">Busyness is a badge of honor, and convenience trumps quality in our quest for quick.</s>
 <s id="38">Our addiction to the express life is choking us and the planet.</s>
 <s id="39">We idolize animals like the cheetah, the "Ferrari of the animal kingdom," capable of doing naught to 60 in three seconds flat.</s>
 <s id="40">Well, so what?</s>
 <s id="41">(Laughter) (Applause) So what?</s>
 <s id="42">The sloth, on the other hand, can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute with the wind behind it.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) But being fast is costly.</s>
 <s id="44">The cheetah is speedy, but at the expense of strength.</s>
 <s id="45">They can't risk getting in a fight, so they lose one in nine kills to tougher predators like hyenas.</s>
 <s id="46">No wonder they're laughing.</s>
 <s id="47">(Laughter) The sloth, on the other hand, has taken a more stealthy approach to dinner.</s>
 <s id="48">They survive by capturing and consuming static leaves.</s>
 <s id="49">(Laughter) But you see, leaves don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do, so they're loaded full of toxins and very hard to digest.</s>
 <s id="50">So in order to consume them, the sloth has also had to become an athlete -- a digesting athlete.</s>
 <s id="51">(Laughter) The sloth's secret weapon is a four-chambered stomach and plenty of time.</s>
 <s id="52">They have the slowest digestion rate of any mammal.</s>
 <s id="53">And it can take up to a month to process a single leaf, which gives their liver plenty of time to process those toxins.</s>
 <s id="54">So, sloths aren't lazy.</s>
 <s id="55">No, they're busy.</s>
 <s id="56">Digesting.</s>
 <s id="57">(Laughter) Yeah, really busy.</s>
 <s id="58">(Laughter) Hard at work, that sloth, very hard at work.</s>
 <s id="59">And of course, leaves have little calorific value, so sloths have evolved to spend as little energy as possible.</s>
 <s id="60">They do about 10 percent of the work of a similar-sized mammal and survive on as little as 100 calories a day, thanks to some ingenious adaptations.</s>
 <s id="61">The Bradypus, three-toed sloths, they've got more neck bones than any other mammal, even a giraffe.</s>
 <s id="62">Which means they can turn their head through 270 degrees and graze all around them, without having to actually bother with the effort of moving their body.</s>
 <s id="63">(Laughter) It also means that they are surprisingly good swimmers.</s>
 <s id="64">Sloths can bob along in water three times faster than they can move on land, kept afloat by ...</s>
 <s id="65">trapped wind.</s>
 <s id="66">(Laughter) So -- (Laughter) sloths are the only mammal that we know of that don't do flatulence.</s>
 <s id="67">When they need to expel gas, it's actually reabsorbed into their bloodstream and expelled orally as a sort of mouth fart.</s>
 <s id="68">(Laughter) Turning their lives upside down saves further energy.</s>
 <s id="69">They have about half the skeletal muscle of a terrestrial mammal.</s>
 <s id="70">They don't really have so many of the extensor muscles that are the weight-bearing muscles; instead, they rely on retractor muscles to pull themselves along.</s>
 <s id="71">They have long, hooked claws and a high fatigue resistance, so they can literally hook on and hang like a happy, hairy hammock for hours on end.</s>
 <s id="72">And sloths can do almost anything in this inverted position.</s>
 <s id="73">They sleep, eat and even give birth.</s>
 <s id="74">Their throat and blood vessels are uniquely adapted to pump blood and to swallow food against the force of gravity.</s>
 <s id="75">They have sticky bits on their ribs that prevent their enormous stomach from crushing their lungs.</s>
 <s id="76">And their fur grows the opposite direction, so they can drip dry after a tropical drenching.</s>
 <s id="77">The only problem is, if you turn a sloth the other way up, gravity removes its dignity.</s>
 <s id="78">Audience: Awww.</s>
 <s id="79">They can't hold themselves upright.</s>
 <s id="80">And so they drag their bodies along as if mountaineering on a flat surface.</s>
 <s id="81">And I think this is why the early explorers like Valdés thought so poorly of them, because they were observing sloths the wrong way up and out of context.</s>
 <s id="82">I've spent many happy hours mesmerized by moving sloths.</s>
 <s id="83">Their lack of muscle hasn't impeded their strength or agility.</s>
 <s id="84">Nature's zen masters of mellow move like "Swan Lake" in slow mo -- (Laughter) with the core control of a tai chi master.</s>
 <s id="85">This one has fallen asleep mid-move, which is not uncommon.</s>
 <s id="86">(Laughter) But you're probably wondering: How does a dangling bag of digesting leaves avoid being eaten?</s>
 <s id="87">Good question.</s>
 <s id="88">Well, this is one of the sloth's main predators.</s>
 <s id="89">It's the harpy eagle.</s>
 <s id="90">It can fly at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, has talons the size of a grizzly bear's, razor-sharp eyesight, and that ring of feathers focuses sound so that it can hear the slightest leaf rustle.</s>
 <s id="91">The sloth, on the other hand, has poor hearing, bad eyesight, and running from danger is clearly not an option.</s>
 <s id="92">No, they survive by wearing an invisibility cloak worthy of Harry Potter.</s>
 <s id="93">Their fur has grooves that attract moisture and act as tiny hydroponic gardens for algae, and they also attract a host of invertebrates.</s>
 <s id="94">So they are their own slow-moving, miniature ecosystem.</s>
 <s id="95">They become one with the trees.</s>
 <s id="96">And we think that their movements are so slow, they slip under the radar of the monstrous harpy as it's flying about the canopy, scanning for action.</s>
 <s id="97">Sloths are stealth ninjas, and they rarely leave the safety of the canopy -- except to defecate, which they do about once a week at the base of a tree.</s>
 <s id="98">Now, this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery, and there are lots of theories as to why they do it.</s>
 <s id="99">But I think they're leaving surreptitious scented messages for potential mates.</s>
 <s id="100">Because, you see, sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures, except for when the female is in heat.</s>
 <s id="101">She will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex.</s>
 <s id="102">In D-sharp.</s>
 <s id="103">(Laughter) Don't believe me?</s>
 <s id="104">(Sound of sloth scream) D-sharp.</s>
 <s id="105">This and only this note will get the male's attention.</s>
 <s id="106">It mimics the sound of the kiskadee flycatcher.</s>
 <s id="107">So the female remains covert, even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs.</s>
 <s id="108">Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy, and males will beat a slow path towards her.</s>
 <s id="109">(Laughter) I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one.</s>
 <s id="110">Sex, by the way, is the only thing that sloths do swiftly.</s>
 <s id="111">I've seen them do it in the wild, and it's over and done with in a matter of seconds.</s>
 <s id="112">But then, why waste precious energy on it, particularly after that journey?</s>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) Unlike other mammals, sloths don't also waste time maintaining a constant warm body temperature.</s>
 <s id="114">Energy from the sun is free, so they bask in the sun like lizards and wear an unusually thick coat for the tropics to keep that heat in.</s>
 <s id="115">Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism.</s>
 <s id="116">And we think that this might be one of the reasons that they can sometimes recover from injuries that would kill most animals.</s>
 <s id="117">This sloth recovered from a double amputation, and I've known sloths that have managed to survive even power line electrocutions.</s>
 <s id="118">And we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction.</s>
 <s id="119">Researchers at Kansas University who were studying mollusks found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk had gone extinct.</s>
 <s id="120">Sloths have been around on this planet in one shape or another for over 40 million years.</s>
 <s id="121">The secret to their success is their slothful nature.</s>
 <s id="122">They are energy-saving icons.</s>
 <s id="123">And I founded the Sloth Appreciation Society to both promote and protect their slow, steady, sustainable lives.</s>
 <s id="124">I'm a pretty speedy character.</s>
 <s id="125">I'm sure you've guessed.</s>
 <s id="126">And the sloths have taught me a lot about slowing down.</s>
 <s id="127">And I think that the planet would benefit if we all took a slowly digested leaf out of their book.</s>
 <s id="128">How about we all embrace our inner sloth by slowing down, being more mindful, reducing wasteful convenience, being economical with our energy, recycling creatively and reconnecting with nature.</s>
 <s id="129">Otherwise, I fear, it will be us humans that turn out to be "the stupidest animals that can be found in the world."</s>
 <s id="130">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="131">May the sloth be with you!</s>
 <s id="132">(Applause)</s>
