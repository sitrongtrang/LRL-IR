 <s id="1">So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.</s>
 <s id="2">And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.</s>
 <s id="3">And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.</s>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time, because we are very immune to this.</s>
  <s id="4.2">This is called alpha-gal epitope.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="5">And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.</s>
 <s id="6">Actually our body doesn't hate these.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Our body loves these.</s>
  <s id="7.2">It eats them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.</s>
 <s id="9">And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell, it means "that's food."</s>
 <s id="10">Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.</s>
 <s id="11">But I said we can't get rid of it, because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can't get rid of that immunity.</s>
 <s id="12">And I said, why don't you use that?</s>
 <s id="13">What if I could stick this molecule, slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?</s>
 <s id="14">I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there, where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.</s>
 <s id="15">It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you, like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A., and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car, and then charges you for possession of marijuana.</s>
 <s id="16">It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.</s>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) So you can take a bacteria that really doesn't make these things at all, and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street.</s>
 <s id="18">And for certain bacteria we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.</s>
 <s id="19">Our antibiotics are running out.</s>
 <s id="20">And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won't be here.</s>
  <s id="21.2">But if we are -- (Laughter) we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">So I started working with this thing, with a bunch of collaborators.</s>
 <s id="23">And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones, bacteria that we don't like.</s>
 <s id="24">And I feel now like George Bush.</s>
 <s id="25">It's like "mission accomplished."</s>
 <s id="26">So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.</s>
 <s id="27">But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.</s>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">And it's killing bacteria.</s>
  <s id="28.2">It's eating them.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.</s>
 <s id="30">You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.</s>
 <s id="31">And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.</s>
 <s id="32">So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">It doesn't respond to antibiotics.</s>
  <s id="33.2">So I don't like it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.</s>
 <s id="35">That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">Here's what happened.</s>
  <s id="36.2">See that line on the very top with the little dots?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="37">That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas, at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.</s>
 <s id="38">And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular, and direct your immune system to it.</s>
 <s id="39">You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line -- that's a 100 percent survival rate.</s>
 <s id="40">And they actually lived another 14 days, or 28 when we finally killed them, and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.</s>
 <s id="41">Why did they not die?</s>
 <s id="42">And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">So we did it.</s>
  <s id="43.2">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="44">(Applause) Mission accomplished!</s>
 <s id="45">(Applause)</s>
