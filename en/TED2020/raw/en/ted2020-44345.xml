 <s id="1">"Who’s there?"</s>
 <s id="2">Whispered in the dark, this question begins a tale of conspiracy, deception and moral ambiguity.</s>
 <s id="3">And in a play where everyone has something to hide, its answer is far from simple.</s>
 <s id="4">Written by William Shakespeare between 1599 and 1601, "Hamlet" depicts its titular character haunted by the past, but immobilized by the future.</s>
 <s id="5">Mere months after the sudden death of his father, Hamlet returns from school a stranger to his own home, and deeply unsure of what might be lurking in the shadows.</s>
 <s id="6">But his brooding takes a turn when he’s visited by a ghost that bears his father’s face.</s>
 <s id="7">The phantom claims to be the victim of a “murder most foul,” and convinces Hamlet that his uncle Claudius usurped the throne and stole queen Gertrude’s heart.</s>
 <s id="8">The prince’s mourning turns to rage, and he begins to plots his revenge on the new king and his court of conspirators.</s>
 <s id="9">The play is an odd sort of tragedy, lacking either the abrupt brutality or all-consuming romance that characterize Shakespeare’s other work in the genre.</s>
 <s id="10">Instead it plumbs the depths of its protagonist’s indecisiveness, and the tragic consequences thereof.</s>
 <s id="11">The ghost’s revelation draws Hamlet into multiple dilemmas– what should he do, who can he trust, and what role might he play in the course of justice?</s>
 <s id="12">These questions are complicated by a tangled web of characters, forcing Hamlet to negotiate friends, family, court counselors, and love interests– many of whom possess ulterior motives.</s>
 <s id="13">The prince constantly delays and dithers over how to relate to others, and how he should carry out revenge.</s>
 <s id="14">This can make Hamlet more than a little exasperating, but it also makes him one of the most human characters Shakespeare ever created.</s>
 <s id="15">Rather than rushing into things, Hamlet becomes consumed with the awful machinations of thinking itself.</s>
 <s id="16">And over the course of the play, his endless questions come to echo throughout our own racing minds.</s>
 <s id="17">To accomplish this, Shakespeare employs his most introspective language.</s>
 <s id="18">From the usurping king’s blazing contemplation of heaven and hell, to the prince’s own cackling meditation on mortality, Shakespeare uses melancholic monologues to breathtaking effect.</s>
 <s id="19">This is perhaps best exemplified in Hamlet’s most famous declaration of angst: "To be or not to be—that is the question: Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And, by opposing, end them."</s>
 <s id="20">This monologue personifies Hamlet’s existential dilemma: being torn between thought and action, unable to choose between life and death.</s>
 <s id="21">But his endless questioning raises yet another anxiety: is Hamlet’s madness part of a performance to confuse his enemies, or are we watching a character on the brink of insanity?</s>
 <s id="22">These questions weigh heavily on Hamlet’s interactions with every character.</s>
 <s id="23">And since he spends much of the play facing inward, he often fails to see the destruction left in his wake.</s>
 <s id="24">He’s particularly cruel to Ophelia, his doomed love interest who is brought to madness by the prince’s erratic behavior.</s>
 <s id="25">Her fate is one example of how tragedy could have been easily avoided, and shows the ripple effect of Hamlet’s toxic mind games.</s>
 <s id="26">Similar warning signs of tragedy are constantly overlooked throughout the play.</s>
 <s id="27">Sometimes, these oversights occur because of willful blindness– such as when Ophelia’s father dismisses Hamlet’s alarming actions as mere lovesickness.</s>
 <s id="28">At other points, tragedy stems from deliberate duplicity– as when a case of mistaken identity leads to yet more bloodshed.</s>
 <s id="29">These moments leave us with the uncomfortable knowledge that tragedy evolves from human error– even if our mistake is to leave things undecided.</s>
 <s id="30">For all these reasons, perhaps the one thing we never doubt is Hamlet’s humanity.</s>
 <s id="31">But we must constantly grapple with who the “real” Hamlet might be.</s>
 <s id="32">Is he a noble son avenging his father?</s>
 <s id="33">Or a mad prince creating courtly chaos?</s>
 <s id="34">Should he act or observe, doubt or trust?</s>
 <p id="p35">
  <s id="35.1">Who is he?</s>
  <s id="35.2">Why is he here?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="36">And who’s out there– waiting in the dark?</s>
