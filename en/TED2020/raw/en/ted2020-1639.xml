 <s id="1">The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.</s>
 <s id="2">Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.</s>
 <s id="3">With complete control of everything the audience can see, moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques to further their deceptions.</s>
 <s id="4">Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life, produced by the sequential projection of still frames, and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.</s>
 <s id="5">Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect.</s>
 <s id="6">Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years.</s>
 <s id="7">Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.</s>
 <s id="8">Playing with the world, and our perception of it, really is the essence of visual effects.</s>
 <s id="9">So digging deeper into this with the Science and Technology Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences reveals some truth behind the trickery.</s>
 <s id="10">Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions: assumption, things are as we know them; presumption, things will behave as we expect; and context in reality, our knowledge of the world as we know it, such as scale.</s>
 <s id="11">Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession, which is, never betray the illusion.</s>
 <s id="12">And that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection.</s>
 <s id="13">So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.</s>
 <s id="14">I hope you will enjoy.</s>
