 <s id="1">(Zombie sounds) Doctor 1: So, how did it get to be this way?</s>
 <s id="2">Doctor 2: Well, it's my professional opinion that the large gaping bite mark on its shoulder might have something to do with it.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">D1: Thanks.</s>
  <s id="3.2">I mean, what causes its behavioral abnormalities?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">D2: Well, we know all behaviors are rooted in the brain, so I'd expect that something's gone terribly wrong probably in there.</s>
 <s id="5">D1: Thanks again, Doctor Obvious.</s>
 <s id="6">Let me be more specific.</s>
 <s id="7">What changes in the brain would have to occur in order to cause this kind of behavior?</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">D2: Hmm.</s>
  <s id="8.2">Well, let's see.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">The first thing I notice is how it moves.</s>
 <s id="10">Stiff legged, with long, lumbering steps, very slow and awkward.</s>
 <s id="11">Almost like what you'd see in Parkinson's disease.</s>
 <s id="12">Maybe something's wrong with his basal ganglia?</s>
 <s id="13">Those are a collection of deep brain regions that regulate movement, through a neurochemical called dopamine.</s>
 <s id="14">Although most people think of dopamine as the "happy" chemical of the brain, the dopamine-containing neurons in the basal ganglia die off in Parkinson's disease, that's what causes it.</s>
 <s id="15">Makes it more and more difficult to initiate actions.</s>
 <s id="16">D1: What?</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Look again at how it moves.</s>
  <s id="17.2">Stiff legs, long stance, These aren't Parkinsonian movements, Parkinson's patients take short, shuffling steps, and the posture's all wrong.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">This looks to me like what happens when the cerebellum is damaged.</s>
 <s id="19">The cerebellum's a little cauliflower-shaped area in the back of your head, but don't let its size fool you.</s>
 <s id="20">That little guy contains almost half of the neurons in the entire brain.</s>
 <s id="21">Patients who suffer degeneration from this region, something called spino-cerebellar ataxia, show a lack of coordination that results in stiff legs, wide stance, and a lumbering walk.</s>
 <s id="22">My money's on the cerebellum.</s>
 <p id="p23">
  <s id="23.1">D2: Touch√©.</s>
  <s id="23.2">OK.</s>
  <s id="23.3">So we've nailed its motor problems.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="24">Now what about that whole groaning, lack of talking thing?</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">D1: Hmm.</s>
  <s id="25.2">You know, it sounds kind of like expressive aphasia, or Broca's aphasia, which makes producing words difficult.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">This is caused by damage to the inferior frontal gyrus, or possibly the anterior insula, both regions behind your temple on the left side of your head.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">D2: I think you're only half right.</s>
  <s id="27.2">Zombies definitely can't communicate, that's for sure.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">But they don't seem to do a good job of understanding things either.</s>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">Watch this.</s>
  <s id="29.2">Hey, Walker!</s>
  <s id="29.3">Your father smelt of elderberries!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">(Laughs) See?</s>
  <s id="30.2">No reaction.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">Either it's not a Monty Python fan, or it can't understand me.</s>
 <s id="32">I'd say this is like spot-on fluent Wernicke's aphasia, damage to an area at the junction of two of the brain's lobes, temporal and parietal, typically on the left side of the brain, is the culprit.</s>
 <s id="33">This area is physically connected to Broca's area, that you mentioned, by a massive bundle of neurofibers called the arcuate fasciculus.</s>
 <s id="34">I hypothesize that this massive bundle of connections is completely wiped out in a zombie.</s>
 <s id="35">It would be like taking out the superhighway between two cities.</s>
 <s id="36">One city that manufactures a product, and the other that ships it out to the rest of the world.</s>
 <s id="37">Without that highway, the product distribution just shuts down.</s>
 <s id="38">D1: So, basically it's a moot point to reason with a zombie, since they can't understand you, let alone talk back.</s>
 <s id="39">D2: (Laughs) I mean, you could try, man, but I'm going to stay on this side of the glass.</s>
