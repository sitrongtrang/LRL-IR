 <s id="1">In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope into scandal by counterfeiting coins.</s>
 <s id="2">When the dust finally settled, the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, his money, and all his possessions.</s>
 <s id="3">At least, that’s how the story goes.</s>
 <s id="4">While many of the details of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas born out of his disgrace survive today.</s>
 <s id="5">In exile, Diogenes decided that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, he could be truly free.</s>
 <s id="6">He would live self-sufficiently, close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity.</s>
 <s id="7">In practice, this meant he spent years wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, baths, and cooked food.</s>
 <s id="8">He didn’t go about this new existence quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating and even masturbating in public.</s>
 <s id="9">The citizens called him a kyôn— a barking dog.</s>
 <s id="10">Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from abstractions like wealth or reputation.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">Diogenes and his growing number of followers became known as “dog philosophers,” or kynikoi, a designation that eventually became the word “Cynic.”</s>
  <s id="11.2">These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom of a wandering lifestyle.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">As Diogenes’ reputation grew, others tried to challenge his commitment.</s>
 <s id="13">Alexander the Great offered him anything he desired.</s>
 <s id="14">But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander to get out of his sunshine.</s>
 <s id="15">After Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE.</s>
 <s id="16">Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone should follow Diogenes’ example.</s>
 <s id="17">They also attempted to tone down his philosophy to be more acceptable to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds with his approach.</s>
 <s id="18">Others viewed the Cynics less charitably.</s>
 <s id="19">In the Roman province of Syria in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached what Diogenes had once actually practiced.</s>
 <s id="20">Reading Lucian’s texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers called their rivals cynics as an insult— meaning people who criticized others without having anything worthwhile to say.</s>
 <s id="21">This usage eventually laid the groundwork for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who thinks everyone else is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive.</s>
 <s id="22">Still, the philosophy of cynicism had admirers, especially among those who wished to question the state of society.</s>
 <s id="23">The 18th-century French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people.</s>
 <s id="24">In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche reimagined a story in which Diogenes went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain for a single honest person.</s>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God is dead.”</s>
  <s id="25.2">This was Nietzsche’s way of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and rejecting the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights beyond the physical world.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">Nietzsche admired Diogenes for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now.</s>
 <s id="27">More recently, the hippies of the 1960s have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels.</s>
 <s id="28">Diogenes’ ideas have been adopted and reimagined over and over again.</s>
 <s id="29">The original cynics might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature were the only true values.</s>
 <s id="30">Whether or not you agree with that, or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common: they questioned the status quo.</s>
 <s id="31">And that’s an example we can still follow: not to blindly follow conventional or majority views, but to think hard about what is truly valuable.</s>
