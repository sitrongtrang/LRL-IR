 <s id="1">In ancient Greece, headaches were considered powerful afflictions.</s>
 <s id="2">Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius, the god of medicine.</s>
 <s id="3">And if pain continued, a medical practitioner would perform the best-known remedy— drilling a small hole in the skull to drain supposedly infected blood.</s>
 <s id="4">This dire technique, called trepanation, often replaced the headache with a more permanent condition.</s>
 <s id="5">Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort to power tools to cure headaches.</s>
 <s id="6">But we still have a lot to learn about this ancient ailment.</s>
 <s id="7">Today, we’ve classified headaches into two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches.</s>
 <s id="8">The former are not symptomatic of an underlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition.</s>
 <s id="9">But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches account for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more about secondary headaches.</s>
 <s id="10">These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease.</s>
 <s id="11">Doctors have classified over 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, symptoms, and treatments.</s>
 <s id="12">But we’ll take just one common case —a sinus infection—as an example.</s>
 <s id="13">The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks.</s>
 <s id="14">When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming the cavities well past their usual size.</s>
 <s id="15">The engorged sinuses put pressure on the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head.</s>
 <s id="16">Their pain receptors, called nociceptors, trigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood of neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood vessels, swelling and heating up the head.</s>
 <s id="17">This discomfort, paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, throbbing pain of a headache.</s>
 <s id="18">Not all headache pain comes from swelling.</s>
 <s id="19">Tense muscles and inflamed, sensitive nerves cause varying degrees of discomfort in each headache.</s>
 <s id="20">But all cases are reactions to some cranial irritant.</s>
 <s id="21">While the cause is clear in secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches remain unknown.</s>
 <s id="22">Scientists are still investigating potential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, rapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, the tension headache.</s>
 <s id="23">As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating the sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head.</s>
 <s id="24">These headaches increase the tenderness of the pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse with blood and oxygen.</s>
 <s id="25">Patients report stress, dehydration, and hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit the symptoms quite right.</s>
 <s id="26">For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually shrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location of the pain in tension headaches.</s>
 <s id="27">Scientists have theories for what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure.</s>
 <s id="28">Meanwhile, most headache research is focused on more severe primary headaches.</s>
 <s id="29">Migraines are recurring headaches, which create a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours to three days.</s>
 <s id="30">In 20% of cases, these attacks are intense enough to overload the brain with electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings.</s>
 <s id="31">This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns and experiencing tingling sensations.</s>
 <s id="32">Cluster headaches, another primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts of pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, and drooping eyelid.</s>
 <s id="33">What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect many people’s quality of life?</s>
 <s id="34">Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs that reduce cranial swelling.</s>
 <s id="35">And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided.</s>
 <s id="36">Migraines and cluster headaches are more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable treatments that work for everyone.</s>
 <s id="37">But thankfully, pharmacologists and neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries that weigh so heavily on our minds.</s>
