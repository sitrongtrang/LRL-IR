 <s id="1">This is a graph that represents the economic history of human civilization.</s>
 <s id="2">[World GDP per capita over the last 200,000 years] There's not much going on, is there.</s>
 <s id="3">For the vast majority of human history, pretty much everyone lived on the equivalent of one dollar per day, and not much changed.</s>
 <s id="4">But then, something extraordinary happened: the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions.</s>
 <s id="5">And the basically flat graph you just saw transforms into this.</s>
 <s id="6">What this graph means is that, in terms of power to change the world, we live in an unprecedented time in human history, and I believe our ethical understanding hasn't yet caught up with this fact.</s>
 <s id="7">The Scientific and Industrial Revolutions transformed both our understanding of the world and our ability to alter it.</s>
 <s id="8">What we need is an ethical revolution so that we can work out how do we use this tremendous bounty of resources to improve the world.</s>
 <s id="9">For the last 10 years, my colleagues and I have developed a philosophy and research program that we call effective altruism.</s>
 <s id="10">It tries to respond to these radical changes in our world, uses evidence and careful reasoning to try to answer this question: How can we do the most good?</s>
 <s id="11">Now, there are many issues you've got to address if you want to tackle this problem: whether to do good through your charity or your career or your political engagement, what programs to focus on, who to work with.</s>
 <s id="12">But what I want to talk about is what I think is the most fundamental problem.</s>
 <s id="13">Of all the many problems that the world faces, which should we be focused on trying to solve first?</s>
 <s id="14">Now, I'm going to give you a framework for thinking about this question, and the framework is very simple.</s>
 <s id="15">A problem's higher priority, the bigger, the more easily solvable and the more neglected it is.</s>
 <s id="16">Bigger is better, because we've got more to gain if we do solve the problem.</s>
 <s id="17">More easily solvable is better because I can solve the problem with less time or money.</s>
 <s id="18">And most subtly, more neglected is better, because of diminishing returns.</s>
 <s id="19">The more resources that have already been invested into solving a problem, the harder it will be to make additional progress.</s>
 <s id="20">Now, the key thing that I want to leave with you is this framework, so that you can think for yourself what are the highest global priorities.</s>
 <s id="21">But I and others in the effective altruism community have converged on three moral issues that we believe are unusually important, score unusually well in this framework.</s>
 <s id="22">First is global health.</s>
 <s id="23">This is supersolvable.</s>
 <s id="24">We have an amazing track record in global health.</s>
 <s id="25">Rates of death from measles, malaria, diarrheal disease are down by over 70 percent.</s>
 <s id="26">And in 1980, we eradicated smallpox.</s>
 <s id="27">I estimate we thereby saved over 60 million lives.</s>
 <s id="28">That's more lives saved than if we'd achieved world peace in that same time period.</s>
 <s id="29">On our current best estimates, we can save a life by distributing long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets for just a few thousand dollars.</s>
 <s id="30">This is an amazing opportunity.</s>
 <s id="31">The second big priority is factory farming.</s>
 <s id="32">This is superneglected.</s>
 <s id="33">There are 50 billion land animals used every year for food, and the vast majority of them are factory farmed, living in conditions of horrific suffering.</s>
 <s id="34">They're probably among the worst-off creatures on this planet, and in many cases, we could significantly improve their lives for just pennies per animal.</s>
 <s id="35">Yet this is hugely neglected.</s>
 <s id="36">There are 3,000 times more animals in factory farms than there are stray pets, but yet, factory farming gets one fiftieth of the philanthropic funding.</s>
 <s id="37">That means additional resources in this area could have a truly transformative impact.</s>
 <s id="38">Now the third area is the one that I want to focus on the most, and that's the category of existential risks: events like a nuclear war or a global pandemic that could permanently derail civilization or even lead to the extinction of the human race.</s>
 <s id="39">Let me explain why I think this is such a big priority in terms of this framework.</s>
 <s id="40">First, size.</s>
 <s id="41">How bad would it be if there were a truly existential catastrophe?</s>
 <s id="42">Well, it would involve the deaths of all seven billion people on this planet and that means you and everyone you know and love.</s>
 <s id="43">That's just a tragedy of unimaginable size.</s>
 <s id="44">But then, what's more, it would also mean the curtailment of humanity's future potential, and I believe that humanity's potential is vast.</s>
 <s id="45">The human race has been around for about 200,000 years, and if she lives as long as a typical mammalian species, she would last for about two million years.</s>
 <s id="46">If the human race were a single individual, she would be just 10 years old today.</s>
 <s id="47">And what's more, the human race isn't a typical mammalian species.</s>
 <s id="48">There's no reason why, if we're careful, we should die off after only two million years.</s>
 <s id="49">The earth will remain habitable for 500 million years to come.</s>
 <s id="50">And if someday, we took to the stars, the civilization could continue for billions more.</s>
 <s id="51">So I think the future is going to be really big, but is it going to be good?</s>
 <s id="52">Is the human race even really worth preserving?</s>
 <s id="53">Well, we hear all the time about how things have been getting worse, but I think that when we take the long run, things have been getting radically better.</s>
 <s id="54">Here, for example, is life expectancy over time.</s>
 <s id="55">Here's the proportion of people not living in extreme poverty.</s>
 <s id="56">Here's the number of countries over time that have decriminalized homosexuality.</s>
 <s id="57">Here's the number of countries over time that have become democratic.</s>
 <s id="58">Then, when we look to the future, there could be so much more to gain again.</s>
 <s id="59">We'll be so much richer, we can solve so many problems that are intractable today.</s>
 <s id="60">So if this is kind of a graph of how humanity has progressed in terms of total human flourishing over time, well, this is what we would expect future progress to look like.</s>
 <s id="61">It's vast.</s>
 <s id="62">Here, for example, is where we would expect no one to live in extreme poverty.</s>
 <s id="63">Here is where we would expect everyone to be better off than the richest person alive today.</s>
 <s id="64">Perhaps here is where we would discover the fundamental natural laws that govern our world.</s>
 <s id="65">Perhaps here is where we discover an entirely new form of art, a form of music we currently lack the ears to hear.</s>
 <s id="66">And this is just the next few thousand years.</s>
 <s id="67">Once we think past that, well, we can't even imagine the heights that human accomplishment might reach.</s>
 <s id="68">So the future could be very big and it could be very good, but are there ways we could lose this value?</s>
 <s id="69">And sadly, I think there are.</s>
 <s id="70">The last two centuries brought tremendous technological progress, but they also brought the global risks of nuclear war and the possibility of extreme climate change.</s>
 <s id="71">When we look to the coming centuries, we should expect to see the same pattern again.</s>
 <s id="72">And we can see some radically powerful technologies on the horizon.</s>
 <s id="73">Synthetic biology might give us the power to create viruses of unprecedented contagiousness and lethality.</s>
 <s id="74">Geoengineering might give us the power to dramatically alter the earth's climate.</s>
 <s id="75">Artificial intelligence might give us the power to create intelligent agents with abilities greater than our own.</s>
 <s id="76">Now, I'm not saying that any of these risks are particularly likely, but when there's so much at stake, even small probabilities matter a great deal.</s>
 <p id="p77">
  <s id="77.1">Imagine if you're getting on a plane and you're kind of nervous, and the pilot reassures you by saying, "There's only a one-in-a-thousand chance of crashing.</s>
  <s id="77.2">Don't worry."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="78">Would you feel reassured?</s>
 <s id="79">For these reasons, I think that preserving the future of humanity is among the most important problems that we currently face.</s>
 <s id="80">But let's keep using this framework.</s>
 <s id="81">Is this problem neglected?</s>
 <s id="82">And I think the answer is yes, and that's because problems that affect future generations are often hugely neglected.</s>
 <s id="83">Why?</s>
 <s id="84">Because future people don't participate in markets today.</s>
 <s id="85">They don't have a vote.</s>
 <s id="86">It's not like there's a lobby representing the interests of those born in 2300 AD.</s>
 <s id="87">They don't get to influence the decisions we make today.</s>
 <s id="88">They're voiceless.</s>
 <s id="89">And that means we still spend a paltry amount on these issues: nuclear nonproliferation, geoengineering, biorisk, artificial intelligence safety.</s>
 <s id="90">All of these receive only a few tens of millions of dollars of philanthropic funding every year.</s>
 <s id="91">That's tiny compared to the 390 billion dollars that's spent on US philanthropy in total.</s>
 <s id="92">The final aspect of our framework then: Is this solvable?</s>
 <s id="93">I believe it is.</s>
 <s id="94">You can contribute with your money, your career or your political engagement.</s>
 <s id="95">With your money, you can support organizations that focus on these risks, like the Nuclear Threat Initiative, which campaigns to take nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert, or the Blue Ribbon Panel, which develops policy to minimize the damage from natural and man-made pandemics, or the Center for Human-Compatible AI, which does technical research to ensure that AI systems are safe and reliable.</s>
 <s id="96">With your political engagement, you can vote for candidates that care about these risks, and you can support greater international cooperation.</s>
 <s id="97">And then with your career, there is so much that you can do.</s>
 <s id="98">Of course, we need scientists and policymakers and organization leaders, but just as importantly, we also need accountants and managers and assistants to work in these organizations that are tackling these problems.</s>
 <s id="99">Now, the research program of effective altruism is still in its infancy, and there's still a huge amount that we don't know.</s>
 <s id="100">But even with what we've learned so far, we can see that by thinking carefully and by focusing on those problems that are big, solvable and neglected, we can make a truly tremendous difference to the world for thousands of years to come.</s>
 <s id="101">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="102">(Applause)</s>
