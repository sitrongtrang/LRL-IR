 <s id="1">Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place.</s>
 <s id="2">It was the 1970s.</s>
 <s id="3">I got into the field very young: I was seven years old.</s>
 <s id="4">And the tool that I used to access virtual reality was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.</s>
 <s id="5">This is a commercial for that particular item: (Video) Voice-over: What a jump!</s>
 <s id="6">Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.</s>
 <s id="7">That gyro-power sends him over 100 feet at top speed.</s>
 <s id="8">Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.</s>
 <s id="9">I rode this motorcycle everywhere.</s>
 <s id="10">And I was there with Evel Knievel; we jumped the Snake River Canyon together.</s>
 <s id="11">I wanted the rocket.</s>
 <s id="12">I never got the rocket, I only got the motorcycle.</s>
 <s id="13">I felt so connected to this world.</s>
 <s id="14">I didn't want to be a storyteller when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">I was there.</s>
  <s id="15.2">Evel Knievel was my friend.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="16">I had so much empathy for him.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">But it didn't work out.</s>
  <s id="17.2">(Laughter) I went to art school.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="18">I started making music videos.</s>
 <s id="19">And this is one of the early music videos that I made: (Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West) CM: You may notice some slight similarities here.</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) And I got that rocket.</s>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) So, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker, and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience.</s>
 <s id="22">And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy for people that are very different than us and worlds completely foreign from our own.</s>
 <s id="23">Unfortunately, Evel Knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him, and he sued us for this video -- (Laughter) -- shortly thereafter.</s>
 <s id="24">On the upside, the man that I worshipped as a child, the man that I wanted to become as an adult, I was finally able to get his autograph.</s>
 <s id="25">(Applause) Let's talk about film now.</s>
 <s id="26">Film, it's an incredible medium, but essentially, it's the same now as it was then.</s>
 <s id="27">It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.</s>
 <s id="28">And we've done incredible things with those rectangles.</s>
 <s id="29">But I started thinking about, is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies to tell stories in different ways and tell different kinds of stories that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking that we've been using for 100 years?</s>
 <s id="30">So I started experimenting, and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.</s>
 <s id="31">And here's one of the early experiments: (Music) So this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."</s>
 <s id="32">It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.</s>
 <s id="33">It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it.</s>
 <s id="34">It's a website.</s>
 <s id="35">And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows.</s>
 <s id="36">And you see this teenager running down a street, and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours.</s>
 <s id="37">And when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.</s>
 <s id="38">And this was great, and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that I had made in rectangles.</s>
 <s id="39">And I'm essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story.</s>
 <s id="40">But then I started thinking, okay, well that's a part of you, but how do I put all of you inside of the frame?</s>
 <s id="41">So to do that, I started making art installations.</s>
 <s id="42">And this is one called "The Treachery of Sanctuary."</s>
 <p id="p43">
  <s id="43.1">It's a triptych.</s>
  <s id="43.2">I'm going to show you the third panel.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="44">(Music) So now I've got you inside of the frame, and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions to this work than the previous one.</s>
 <s id="45">But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?</s>
 <s id="46">And a frame is just a window.</s>
 <s id="47">I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema -- they're these windows into these other worlds.</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">And I thought, well, great.</s>
  <s id="48.2">I got you in a frame.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">But I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window, I want you through the window, I want you on the other side, in the world, inhabiting the world.</s>
 <s id="50">So that leads me back to virtual reality.</s>
 <s id="51">Let's talk about virtual reality.</s>
 <s id="52">Unfortunately, talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.</s>
 <s id="53">And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality.</s>
 <p id="p54">
  <s id="54.1">(Laughter) So, it's difficult to explain.</s>
  <s id="54.2">Why is it difficult to explain?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="55">It's difficult because it's a very experiential medium.</s>
 <s id="56">You feel your way inside of it.</s>
 <s id="57">It's a machine, but inside of it, it feels like real life, it feels like truth.</s>
 <s id="58">And you feel present in the world that you're inside and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with.</s>
 <s id="59">So, I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film: a full-screen version of all the information that we capture when we shoot virtual reality.</s>
 <s id="60">So we're shooting in every direction.</s>
 <s id="61">This is a camera system that we built that has 3D cameras that look in every direction and binaural microphones that face in every direction.</s>
 <s id="62">We take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit.</s>
 <s id="63">So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world, it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle.</s>
 <s id="64">So this film is called "Clouds Over Sidra," and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE and the United Nations, and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.</s>
 <s id="65">And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra.</s>
 <s id="66">And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half.</s>
 <s id="67">(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.</s>
 <s id="68">I am 12 years old.</s>
 <s id="69">I am in the fifth grade.</s>
 <s id="70">I am from Syria, in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.</s>
 <s id="71">I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half.</s>
 <s id="72">I have a big family: three brothers, one is a baby.</s>
 <s id="73">He cries a lot.</s>
 <s id="74">I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not.</s>
 <s id="75">I think I was a stronger baby than my brother.</s>
 <s id="76">CM: So, when you're inside of the headset.</s>
 <s id="77">you're not seeing it like this.</s>
 <s id="78">You're looking around through this world.</s>
 <s id="79">You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions.</s>
 <s id="80">And when you're sitting there in her room, watching her, you're not watching it through a television screen, you're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her.</s>
 <s id="81">When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on.</s>
 <s id="82">And because of that, you feel her humanity in a deeper way.</s>
 <s id="83">You empathize with her in a deeper way.</s>
 <s id="84">And I think that we can change minds with this machine.</s>
 <s id="85">And we've already started to try to change a few.</s>
 <s id="86">So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.</s>
 <s id="87">And we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people.</s>
 <s id="88">And these are people who might not otherwise be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in Jordan.</s>
 <s id="89">But in January, one afternoon in Switzerland, they suddenly all found themselves there.</s>
 <s id="90">(Applause) And they were affected by it.</s>
 <s id="91">So we're going to make more of them.</s>
 <s id="92">We're working with the United Nations right now to shoot a whole series of these films.</s>
 <s id="93">We just finished shooting a story in Liberia.</s>
 <s id="94">And now, we're going to shoot a story in India.</s>
 <s id="95">And we're taking these films, and we're showing them at the United Nations to people that work there and people that are visiting there.</s>
 <s id="96">And we're showing them to the people that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films.</s>
 <s id="97">And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality.</s>
 <s id="98">It's not a video game peripheral.</s>
 <s id="99">It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media.</s>
 <s id="100">And it can change people's perception of each other.</s>
 <s id="101">And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world.</s>
 <s id="102">So, it's a machine, but through this machine we become more compassionate, we become more empathetic, and we become more connected.</s>
 <s id="103">And ultimately, we become more human.</s>
 <s id="104">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="105">(Applause)</s>
