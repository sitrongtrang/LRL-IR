 <s id="1">In the grasslands of Mauritania, a gazelle suffering from tuberculosis takes its last breath.</s>
 <s id="2">Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse threatens to infect the water.</s>
 <s id="3">But for the desert’s cleanup crew, this body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast.</s>
 <s id="4">Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan of nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture is the undisputed king of the carcass.</s>
 <s id="5">This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide and muscle tissue, opening entry points for weaker vultures to dig in.</s>
 <s id="6">This colossal competition is too dangerous for the tiny Egyptian vulture.</s>
 <s id="7">With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa from his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft for hours at a time.</s>
 <s id="8">But upon arrival, he finds himself near the bottom of the pecking order.</s>
 <s id="9">Fortunately, what he lacks in size, he makes up for in intelligence.</s>
 <s id="10">A short distance away, he spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs.</s>
 <s id="11">Using a large rock, he smashes one open for a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle once the larger birds are gone.</s>
 <s id="12">High above the commotion are Ruppell’s Griffon vultures.</s>
 <s id="13">Soaring at an altitude of over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher than any other animal.</s>
 <s id="14">At this height, they can’t see individual carcasses.</s>
 <s id="15">But the sight of their fellow vultures guides them to the feeding.</s>
 <s id="16">Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature as they descend— and keep them clean as they tear into the decaying gazelle.</s>
 <s id="17">The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat infects the water supply.</s>
 <s id="18">And the tuberculosis doesn’t stand a chance at infecting the vultures.</s>
 <s id="19">These birds have evolved the lowest gastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased carrion and waste without becoming sick.</s>
 <s id="20">In fact, species like the mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones in just 24 hours.</s>
 <s id="21">This adaptation helps smaller vultures supplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume diseased meat up to 3 days old.</s>
 <s id="22">Their acidic stomachs protect them from living animals too: their rancid vomit scares off most predators.</s>
 <s id="23">These stomachs of steel are essential to removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies from the African ecosystem.</s>
 <s id="24">But while vultures can easily digest natural waste, man-made chemicals are another story.</s>
 <s id="25">Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug used to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures.</s>
 <s id="26">And because local religious beliefs prohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses.</s>
 <s id="27">Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons and habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline in the region’s vulture population.</s>
 <s id="28">In nearby Africa, poachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from alerting authorities to their location.</s>
 <s id="29">One poisoned carcass can kill over 500 vultures.</s>
 <s id="30">Today, more than 50% of all vulture species are endangered.</s>
 <s id="31">In regions where vultures have gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay.</s>
 <s id="32">These carcasses contaminate drinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry the diseases into human communities.</s>
 <s id="33">The Asian and African Vulture Crisis has led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly 20,000 people each year.</s>
 <s id="34">Fortunately, some communities have already realized how important vultures are.</s>
 <s id="35">Conservationists have successfully banned drugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working to repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs.</s>
 <s id="36">Some regions have even opened vulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose of drug-free livestock.</s>
 <s id="37">With help, vultures will be able to continue their role conserving the health of our planet— transforming death and decay into life.</s>
