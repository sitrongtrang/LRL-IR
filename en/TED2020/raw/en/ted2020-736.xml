 <s id="1">In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.</s>
 <s id="2">Millions of people were in severe need of help.</s>
 <s id="3">The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.</s>
 <s id="4">But there were no maps, no maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.</s>
 <s id="5">When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.</s>
 <s id="6">The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having detailed maps.</s>
 <s id="7">But help was coming.</s>
 <s id="8">At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.</s>
 <s id="9">And it took them four days.</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">The new software they used?</s>
  <s id="10.2">Google Mapmaker.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="11">Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally.</s>
 <s id="12">People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and video stores to the corner store.</s>
 <s id="13">Maps matter.</s>
 <s id="14">Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.</s>
 <s id="15">For example, a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.</s>
 <s id="16">In the last year alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information, and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.</s>
 <s id="17">And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere.</s>
 <s id="18">Let's look at some of the maps being created by users right now.</s>
 <s id="19">So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries.</s>
 <s id="20">You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.</s>
 <s id="21">And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.</s>
 <s id="22">This is the result of computational geometry, gesture recognition, and machine learning.</s>
 <s id="23">This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of cities, one user, one edit at a time.</s>
 <s id="24">This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet.</s>
 <s id="25">Welcome to the new world.</s>
