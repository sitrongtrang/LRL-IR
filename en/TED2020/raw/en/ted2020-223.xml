  <s id="1.1">Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs.</s>
  <s id="1.2">Here we go.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show; it's something we just kind of learned for this, so we're going to try.</s>
  <s id="3.2">But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p4">
  <s id="4.1">BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show.</s>
  <s id="4.2">You are the man!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">Nice show.</s>
  <s id="5.2">Man, that was good!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">DH: Thank you.</s>
 <s id="7">BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">You actually just did that.</s>
  <s id="8.2">(Laughter) That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">DH: All right, let's show them something special.</s>
 <s id="10">BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">Yeah, look at this.</s>
  <s id="11.2">You know, all kinds of different ...</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">TED is about invention, let's be honest.</s>
  <s id="12.2">Right?</s>
  <s id="12.3">DH: Yeah, it is.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on.</s>
 <s id="14">Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.</s>
 <s id="15">DH: A type of juggling I actually invented, right after I saw another juggler do it.</s>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">BF: Shut up.</s>
  <s id="16.2">(Laughter) DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">(Laughter) (Applause) Folks, this is shaker cup juggling.</s>
  <s id="17.2">It's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">BF: Oh yeah, it does.</s>
  <s id="18.2">(Drum roll) BF: Oh, Daniel.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p19">
  <s id="19.1">(Applause) DH: One more?</s>
  <s id="19.2">(Drum roll) Perfect.</s>
  <s id="19.3">(Drum roll) Perfect.</s>
  <s id="19.4">(Drum roll) BF: OK.</s>
  <s id="19.5">DH: Oh!</s>
  <s id="19.6">All right.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="20">(Applause) I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.</s>
 <p id="p21">
  <s id="21.1">In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.</s>
  <s id="21.2">(Drum roll) BF: Also three with his left.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="22">DH: Perfect.</s>
 <p id="p23">
  <s id="23.1">(Laughter) And now, all six cups.</s>
  <s id="23.2">Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose?</s>
  <s id="23.3">(Laughter) BF: First try?</s>
  <s id="23.4">Once on purpose?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">(Audience: Once on purpose!)</s>
  <s id="24.2">DH: How about if I try first and then decide?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p25">
  <s id="25.1">BF: Good idea.</s>
  <s id="25.2">(Laughter) Let's leave that.</s>
  <s id="25.3">We'll leave that door open.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) (Applause) DH: He's looking at me.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">BF: That's all right, he does that.</s>
  <s id="27.2">All right.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">DH: Oh!</s>
  <s id="28.2">It's time for Richard's help.</s>
  <s id="28.3">(Laughter) Oh, good.</s>
  <s id="28.4">All right.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p29">
  <s id="29.1">BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard.</s>
  <s id="29.2">And we've always done something with the bullwhips in our act.</s>
  <s id="29.3">It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="30">And then we thought, "How stupid."</s>
 <s id="31">DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?</s>
 <s id="32">BF: I think that's the next session.</s>
 <s id="33">DH: Next session?</s>
 <p id="p34">
  <s id="34.1">BF: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="34.2">And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="35">He actually assumes more of the danger in this.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">DH: Please stand up, Richard.</s>
  <s id="36.2">(Whip cracks) Oh, sorry.</s>
  <s id="36.3">(Laughter) DH: Now Richard, please ...</s>
  <s id="36.4">(Whip cracks) BF: OK, sorry.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">DH: Jesus Christ.</s>
  <s id="37.2">Richard, please stand in front of me.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">Richard Wurman: Can I say something?</s>
 <s id="39">BF: Sure.</s>
 <s id="40">RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them, the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.</s>
 <s id="41">DH: All right, please stand here in front ...</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">God, I hate that.</s>
  <s id="42.2">Put your hands out like this, please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) BF: No, come stay up with him.</s>
 <s id="44">Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.</s>
 <p id="p45">
  <s id="45.1">It's kind of neat.</s>
  <s id="45.2">OK.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) DH: Wow, you've been working out.</s>
 <s id="47">BF: No, shut up!</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">(Laughter) Having a little bit of Richard time.</s>
  <s id="48.2">That's nice, that's good.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">OK, here we go.</s>
 <s id="50">Have him hold your wrist so I can ...</s>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">DH: Please hold my wrist, will you.</s>
  <s id="51.2">BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">There you go.</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) OK.</s>
 <s id="54">OK, hold on.</s>
 <s id="55">RW: Hmmm.</s>
 <s id="56">(Laughter) DH: First one.</s>
 <s id="57">BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">(Laughter) DH: So Richard, what were we on the list?</s>
  <s id="58.2">Like 1,020?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) What happened there?</s>
 <s id="60">BF: I think we were just outside.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">DH: I don't get it.</s>
  <s id="61.2">(Applause) (Laughter) DH: Sorry.</s>
  <s id="61.3">BF: Having some bad flashbacks.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">RW: Do you want me to hold you or not?</s>
  <s id="62.2">DH: Don't hold me that hard.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">BF: Here we go, I'm taking it.</s>
  <s id="63.2">(Balloon pops) (Applause) DH: One more, one more.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="64">BF: We've got one more we're going to do.</s>
 <s id="65">RW: Do I get to hold them?</s>
 <s id="66">BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.</s>
 <s id="67">DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?</s>
 <p id="p68">
  <s id="68.1">(Laughter) BF: Gloria, you want to do it?</s>
  <s id="68.2">It's very cool.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">(Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) One more try.</s>
  <s id="69.2">Man, I don't want to get too close.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">(Laughter) Could you just push that?</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">(Applause) DH: Wow!</s>
  <s id="71.2">Boy!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">BF: That's cool.</s>
  <s id="72.2">I always wanted to try that.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">(Laughter) DH: Let's jump this way, though.</s>
 <s id="74">Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.</s>
 <s id="75">So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.</s>
 <s id="76">And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...</s>
 <p id="p77">
  <s id="77.1">(Laughter) DH: Wow!</s>
  <s id="77.2">BF: Hoping for a little more build.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p78">
  <s id="78.1">DH: True.</s>
  <s id="78.2">Barry ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="79">BF: I'm going to run up behind him.</s>
 <s id="80">DH: Leap over my shoulder.</s>
 <s id="81">BF: Up and over his shoulders.</s>
 <s id="82">DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...</s>
 <p id="p83">
  <s id="83.1">(Laughter) Still juggling.</s>
  <s id="83.2">(Laughter) Impossible, you say?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="84">BF: Incredible, you say?</s>
 <s id="85">DH: Why bother, you say?</s>
 <s id="86">BF: Here we go.</s>
 <s id="87">DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?</s>
 <s id="88">BF: This guy, this guy invented air.</s>
 <s id="89">DH: I think so, that's right.</s>
 <s id="90">Even the pencil.</s>
 <s id="91">BF: He invented the pencil.</s>
 <s id="92">DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect.</s>
 <s id="93">BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.</s>
 <s id="94">DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">BF: No, it's a hassle.</s>
  <s id="95.2">Traveling too much.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="96">Actually, we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.</s>
 <s id="97">DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage?</s>
 <s id="98">(Laughter) Or a virgin for a sacrifice?</s>
 <s id="99">BF: Anything?</s>
 <p id="p100">
  <s id="100.1">DH: Where's Gloria?</s>
  <s id="100.2">(Laughter) BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="101">DH: Do you have a small farm animal?</s>
 <p id="p102">
  <s id="102.1">Just trying to play the odds.</s>
  <s id="102.2">All right, here we go.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="103">BF: Over the top, over the top.</s>
 <p id="p104">
  <s id="104.1">DH: How you feeling, Barry?</s>
  <s id="104.2">You feeling all right?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="105">BF: Yeah, it's all right.</s>
 <p id="p106">
  <s id="106.1">DH: Do you feel everything's OK?</s>
  <s id="106.2">The atmosphere, the ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="107">BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.</s>
 <s id="108">DH: Everything up here's OK?</s>
 <s id="109">BF: Yeah.</s>
 <s id="110">DH: Then here we go.</s>
 <p id="p111">
  <s id="111.1">BF: This one's a little ...</s>
  <s id="111.2">Who's doing the lights?</s>
  <s id="111.3">Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs?</s>
  <s id="111.4">Is that possible?</s>
  <s id="111.5">(Laughter) I can still see a little.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="112">DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.</s>
 <p id="p113">
  <s id="113.1">We went too far.</s>
  <s id="113.2">(Laughter) BF: Yeah, it's too far.</s>
  <s id="113.3">It's too much of a visual.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="114">The design of the body is a whole different thing.</s>
 <p id="p115">
  <s id="115.1">DH: Ready, Barry?</s>
  <s id="115.2">BF: Over the top.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p116">
  <s id="116.1">DH: May we have our jumping music please?</s>
  <s id="116.2">(Silence) May we have it a bit louder?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p117">
  <s id="117.1">(Laughter) BF: They're a good crew!</s>
  <s id="117.2">Whoa!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p118">
  <s id="118.1">DH: Whoa, sorry.</s>
  <s id="118.2">All right.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="119">BF: We're going on.</s>
 <s id="120">DH: All right, we'll try again.</s>
 <p id="p121">
  <s id="121.1">BF: All right?</s>
  <s id="121.2">Oh my gosh.</s>
  <s id="121.3">Oh.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p122">
  <s id="122.1">DH: All right, here we go.</s>
  <s id="122.2">Sorry about that.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p123">
  <s id="123.1">BF: I thought I had the hard part.</s>
  <s id="123.2">OK.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="124">DH: Whenever you're ready.</s>
 <s id="125">BF: There we go!</s>
 <p id="p126">
  <s id="126.1">(Applause) All right, get up!</s>
  <s id="126.2">Come on and dance!</s>
  <s id="126.3">DH: Dance, come on.</s>
  <s id="126.4">BF: Come on and dance!</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p127">
  <s id="127.1">Somebody dance!</s>
  <s id="127.2">Come on!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="128">(Applause) Wow, wow, OK, stop.</s>
 <p id="p129">
  <s id="129.1">Weird, no one dances.</s>
  <s id="129.2">We're two guys doing this.</s>
  <s id="129.3">(Laughter) I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="130">DH: The French judge ...</s>
 <s id="131">BF: One more quick thing.</s>
 <s id="132">DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.</s>
 <s id="133">(Laughter) BF: Well, you know ...</s>
 <p id="p134">
  <s id="134.1">DH: There you go ...</s>
  <s id="134.2">BF: Oh, yeah.</s>
  <s id="134.3">Another one coming in.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="135">DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.</s>
 <p id="p136">
  <s id="136.1">BF: Yeah.</s>
  <s id="136.2">In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="137">And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.</s>
 <s id="138">We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition.</s>
 <s id="139">DH: That's right.</s>
 <s id="140">BF: Good.</s>
 <s id="141">DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.</s>
 <s id="142">(Laughter) BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.</s>
 <s id="143">DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.</s>
 <s id="144">And look, it has a twin!</s>
 <p id="p145">
  <s id="145.1">BF: Shut up.</s>
  <s id="145.2">(Laughter) DH: There's still one more by my foot.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="146">What do you want me to do with it?</s>
 <p id="p147">
  <s id="147.1">BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year.</s>
  <s id="147.2">(Laughter) DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p148">
  <s id="148.1">BF: Yeah, it's a good setup.</s>
  <s id="148.2">That's a big setup.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p149">
  <s id="149.1">DH: You can't get any better than that.</s>
  <s id="149.2">All right.</s>
  <s id="149.3">What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="150">BF: Nice.</s>
 <s id="151">DH: I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.</s>
 <s id="152">BF: Nice.</s>
 <p id="p153">
  <s id="153.1">DH: I touched it, Barry.</s>
  <s id="153.2">That should be enough.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="154">BF: It's progress, that's the thing.</s>
 <p id="p155">
  <s id="155.1">(Laughter) DH: How about that?</s>
  <s id="155.2">I'll do it again.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="156">Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.</s>
 <s id="157">And it's awfully windy over there.</s>
 <p id="p158">
  <s id="158.1">BF: It is, it's weird.</s>
  <s id="158.2">You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is.</s>
  <s id="158.3">It's weird.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="159">Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.</s>
 <p id="p160">
  <s id="160.1">DH: Wow!</s>
  <s id="160.2">What a great trick, Barry!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="161">Oh, look how it lies there.</s>
 <s id="162">Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?</s>
 <p id="p163">
  <s id="163.1">(Laughter) You are my hero.</s>
  <s id="163.2">You're my Jim Shea, Jr.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="164">Too much Olympics.</s>
 <p id="p165">
  <s id="165.1">BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club.</s>
  <s id="165.2">Here we go.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p166">
  <s id="166.1">DH: Where, Barry?</s>
  <s id="166.2">Where?</s>
  <s id="166.3">Tell us, Barry.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p167">
  <s id="167.1">[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable.</s>
  <s id="167.2">What will it be?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="168">What gem of knowledge?</s>
 <s id="169">What pearl of wisdom?</s>
 <s id="170">Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?</s>
 <s id="171">Is that your final answer?</s>
 <p id="p172">
  <s id="172.1">BF: All right!</s>
  <s id="172.2">You have to turn off the TV from time to time.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="173">DH: I do, I do.</s>
 <s id="174">BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.</s>
 <s id="175">DH: We will juggle seven.</s>
 <p id="p176">
  <s id="176.1">BF: From six to seven.</s>
  <s id="176.2">DH: That's a world's record.</s>
  <s id="176.3">BF: Really?</s>
  <s id="176.4">DH: For us.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="177">BF: Yes.</s>
 <s id="178">DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.</s>
 <s id="179">Put your tongue away, Barry.</s>
 <s id="180">BF: Oh, oh, whoa.</s>
 <p id="p181">
  <s id="181.1">(Applause) DH: Please, please stay seated.</s>
  <s id="181.2">Stay seated.</s>
  <s id="181.3">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="182">Because now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...</s>
 <s id="183">BF: Seven-club juggling.</s>
 <s id="184">DH: ... to back.</s>
 <s id="185">BF: Thank you, that's it.</s>
 <s id="186">BF: Thank you guys!</s>
 <s id="187">DH: Thank you very much!</s>
