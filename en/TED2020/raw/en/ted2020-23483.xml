 <s id="1">Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind when we think of cemeteries.</s>
 <s id="2">But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones.</s>
 <s id="3">How did our cemeteries become what they are today?</s>
 <s id="4">Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million people are buried.</s>
 <s id="5">But most of the places we’d recognize as cemeteries are much younger.</s>
 <s id="6">In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all.</s>
 <s id="7">Our ancient ancestors had many other ways of parting with the dead loved ones.</s>
 <s id="8">Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops.</s>
 <s id="9">Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated.</s>
 <s id="10">All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead.</s>
 <s id="11">By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead.</s>
 <s id="12">But the first burials revealed some advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the sight of decay.</s>
 <s id="13">These benefits may have shifted ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common.</s>
 <s id="14">Sometimes, these graves contained practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife where the dead might need such tools.</s>
 <s id="15">Communal burials first appeared in North Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first permanent settlements in these areas.</s>
 <s id="16">These burial grounds created permanent places to commemorate the dead.</s>
 <s id="17">The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans.</s>
 <s id="18">The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets lined with tombs.</s>
 <s id="19">In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains.</s>
 <s id="20">The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities.</s>
 <s id="21">In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, and other events.</s>
 <s id="22">Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made for sweeter milk.</s>
 <s id="23">As cities grew during the industrial revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced smaller urban churchyards.</s>
 <p id="p24">
  <s id="24.1">Cemeteries like the 110-acre Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt.</s>
  <s id="24.2">Auburn in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="25">Once a luxury reserved for the rich and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle and working classes.</s>
 <s id="26">People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors.</s>
 <s id="27">By the late 19th century, as more public parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors.</s>
 <s id="28">Today, many old cemeteries are lonely places.</s>
 <s id="29">Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions.</s>
 <s id="30">But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial.</s>
 <s id="31">Cities like London, New York, and Hong Kong are running out of burial space.</s>
 <s id="32">Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated or developed.</s>
 <s id="33">Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals.</s>
 <s id="34">With increasing awareness of the environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives.</s>
 <s id="35">Many are turning to cremation and related practices.</s>
 <s id="36">Along with these more conventional practices, people can now have their remains shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink.</s>
 <s id="37">In the future, options like these may replace burial completely.</s>
 <s id="38">Cemeteries may be our most familiar monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead.</s>
