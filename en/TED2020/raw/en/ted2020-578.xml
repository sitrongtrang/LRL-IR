 <s id="1">My journey to coming here today started in 1974.</s>
 <s id="2">That's me with the funny gloves.</s>
 <s id="3">I was 17 and going on a peace walk.</s>
 <s id="4">What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there with me, were Moonies.</s>
 <s id="5">(Laughter) And within a week I had come to believe that the second coming of Christ had occurred, that it was Sun Myung Moon, and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God to be his disciple.</s>
 <s id="6">Now as cool as that sounds, my family was not that thrilled with this.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.</s>
 <p id="p8">
  <s id="8.1">There was an underground railroad of sorts that was going on during those years.</s>
  <s id="8.2">Maybe some of you remember it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="9">They were called deprogrammers.</s>
 <s id="10">And after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed.</s>
 <s id="11">And I then became a deprogrammer.</s>
 <s id="12">I started going out on cases.</s>
 <s id="13">And after about five years of doing this, I was arrested for kidnapping.</s>
 <s id="14">Most of the cases I went out on were called involuntary.</s>
 <s id="15">What happened was that the family had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.</s>
 <s id="16">And so they took them to some safe place.</s>
 <s id="17">And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.</s>
 <s id="18">And so after this happened, I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.</s>
 <s id="19">And about 20 years went by.</s>
 <s id="20">There was a burning question though that would not leave me.</s>
 <s id="21">And that was, "How did this happen to me?"</s>
 <s id="22">And in fact, what did happen to my brain?</s>
 <s id="23">Because something did.</s>
 <s id="24">And so I decided to write a book, a memoir, about this decade of my life.</s>
 <s id="25">And toward the end of writing that book there was a documentary that came out.</s>
 <s id="26">It was on Jonestown.</s>
 <s id="27">And it had a chilling effect on me.</s>
 <s id="28">These are the dead in Jonestown.</s>
 <s id="29">About 900 people died that day, most of them taking their own lives.</s>
 <s id="30">Women gave poison to their babies, and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.</s>
 <s id="31">The top picture is a group of Moonies that have been blessed by their messiah.</s>
 <s id="32">Their mates were chosen for them.</s>
 <s id="33">The bottom picture is Hitler youth.</s>
 <s id="34">This is the leg of a suicide bomber.</s>
 <s id="35">The thing I had to admit to myself, with great repulsion, was that I get it.</s>
 <s id="36">I understand how this could happen.</s>
 <s id="37">I understand how someone's brain, how someone's mind can come to the place where it makes sense -- in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that -- not to try to save the world through genocide.</s>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">And so what is this?</s>
  <s id="38.2">How does this work?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">And how I've come to view what happened to me is a viral, memetic infection.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics, a meme has been defined as an idea that replicates in the human brain and moves from brain to brain like a virus, much like a virus.</s>
  <s id="40.2">The way a virus works is -- it can infect and do the most damage to someone who has a compromised immune system.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="41">In 1974, I was young, I was naive, and I was pretty lost in my world.</s>
 <s id="42">I was really idealistic.</s>
 <s id="43">These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing when you are emotionally vulnerable.</s>
 <s id="44">What happens is that circular logic takes over.</s>
 <s id="45">"Moon is one with God.</s>
 <s id="46">God is going to fix all the problems in the world.</s>
 <s id="47">All I have to do is humbly follow.</s>
 <s id="48">Because God is going to stop war and hunger -- all these things I wanted to do -- all I have to do is humbly follow.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah.</s>
  <s id="49.2">He's going to fix all this."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">It becomes impenetrable.</s>
 <s id="51">And the most dangerous part of this is that is creates "us" and "them," "right" and "wrong," "good" and "evil."</s>
 <s id="52">And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable.</s>
 <p id="p53">
  <s id="53.1">And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday.</s>
  <s id="53.2">Science is expanding.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="54">We're beginning to look inside the brain.</s>
 <s id="55">And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different.</s>
 <s id="56">And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.</s>
 <s id="57">And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.</s>
 <p id="p58">
  <s id="58.1">But it's a human problem.</s>
  <s id="58.2">It's a scientific problem, if you will.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">It happens in the human brain.</s>
  <s id="59.2">There is no evil force out there to get us.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">And so this is something that, through research and education, I believe that we can solve.</s>
 <s id="61">And so the first step is to realize that we can do this together, and that there is no "us" and "them."</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">Thank you very much.</s>
  <s id="62.2">(Applause)</s>
