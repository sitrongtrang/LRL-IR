 <s id="1">In June of 1998, Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head, North Carolina for France.</s>
 <s id="2">That's her boat, the American Pearl.</s>
 <s id="3">It's 23 feet long and just six feet across at its widest point.</s>
 <s id="4">The deck was the size of a cargo bed of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.</s>
 <s id="5">Tori and her friends built it by hand, and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.</s>
 <s id="6">Her plan was to row it alone across the Atlantic Ocean -- no motor, no sail -- something no woman and no American had ever done before.</s>
 <s id="7">This would be her route: over 3,600 miles across the open North Atlantic Ocean.</s>
 <s id="8">Professionally, Tori worked as a project administrator for the city of Louisville, Kentucky, her hometown, but her real passion was exploring.</s>
 <s id="9">This was not her first big expedition.</s>
 <s id="10">Several years earlier, she'd become the first woman to ski to the South Pole.</s>
 <s id="11">She was an accomplished rower in college, even competed for a spot on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, but this, this was different.</s>
 <p id="p12">
  <s id="12.1">(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure: Hi.</s>
  <s id="12.2">It's Sunday, July 5.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="13">Sector time 9 a.m.</s>
 <s id="14">So that's Kentucky time now.</s>
 <s id="15">Dawn Landes: Tori made these videos as she rowed.</s>
 <s id="16">This is her 21st day at sea.</s>
 <s id="17">At this point, she'd covered over 1,000 miles, had had no radio contact in more than two weeks following a storm that disabled all her long-range communications systems just five days in.</s>
 <s id="18">Most days looked like this.</s>
 <s id="19">At this point, she'd rowed over 200,000 strokes, fighting the current and the wind.</s>
 <s id="20">Some days, she traveled as little as 15 feet.</s>
 <s id="21">Yeah.</s>
 <s id="22">And as frustrating as those days were, other days were like this.</s>
 <s id="23">(Video) TMM: And I want to show you my little friends.</s>
 <s id="24">DL: She saw fish, dolphins, whales, sharks, and even some sea turtles.</s>
 <s id="25">After two weeks with no human contact, Tori was able to contact a local cargo ship via VHF radio.</s>
 <s id="26">(Video) TMM: Do you guys have a weather report, over?</s>
 <s id="27">Man: Heading up to a low ahead of you but it's heading, and you're obviously going northeast and there's a high behind us.</s>
 <s id="28">That'd be coming east-northeast also.</s>
 <s id="29">TMM: Good.</s>
 <s id="30">DL: She's pretty happy to talk to another human at this point.</s>
 <s id="31">(Video) TMM: So weather report says nothing dramatic is going to happen soon.</s>
 <s id="32">DL: What the weather report didn't tell her was that she was rowing right into the path of Hurricane Danielle in the worst hurricane season on record in the North Atlantic.</s>
 <s id="33">(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.</s>
 <s id="34">There's a very strong wind from the east now.</s>
 <s id="35">It's blowing about.</s>
 <s id="36">It's blowing!</s>
 <s id="37">After 12 days of storm I get to row for four hours without a flagging wind.</s>
 <s id="38">I'm not very happy right now.</s>
 <s id="39">As happy as I was this morning, I am unhappy now, so ...</s>
 <s id="40">DL: After nearly three months at sea, she'd covered over 3,000 miles.</s>
 <s id="41">She was two thirds of the way there, but in the storm, the waves were the size of a seven-story building.</s>
 <s id="42">Her boat kept capsizing.</s>
 <s id="43">Some of them were pitchpole capsizes, flipping her end over end, and rowing became impossible.</s>
 <s id="44">(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.</s>
 <s id="45">I'm in something big, bad and ugly.</s>
 <s id="46">Two capsizes.</s>
 <s id="47">Last capsize, I took the rib off the top of my ceiling with my back.</s>
 <s id="48">I've had about six capsizes now.</s>
 <s id="49">The last one was a pitchpole.</s>
 <s id="50">I have the Argus beacon with me.</s>
 <s id="51">I would set off the distress signal, but quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat.</s>
 <s id="52">It's so far underwater right now, the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin.</s>
 <s id="53">It's about 10 a.m.</s>
 <s id="54">I've lost track of the number of capsizes.</s>
 <s id="55">I seem to capsize about every 15 minutes.</s>
 <s id="56">I think I may have broken my left arm.</s>
 <s id="57">The waves are tearing the boat to shreds.</s>
 <s id="58">I keep praying because I'm not sure I'm going to make it through this.</s>
 <s id="59">DL: Tori set off her distress beacon and was rescued by a passing container ship.</s>
 <s id="60">They found her abandoned boat two months later adrift near France.</s>
 <s id="61">I read about it in the newspaper.</s>
 <s id="62">In 1998, I was a high school student living in Louisville, Kentucky.</s>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">Now, I live in New York City.</s>
  <s id="63.2">I'm a songwriter.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="64">And her bravery stuck with me, and I'm adapting her story into a musical called "Row."</s>
 <s id="65">When Tori returned home, she was feeling disheartened, she was broke.</s>
 <s id="66">She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization.</s>
 <s id="67">In this scene, she sits at home.</s>
 <s id="68">The phone is ringing, her friends are calling, but she doesn't know how to talk to them.</s>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">She sings this song.</s>
  <s id="69.2">It's called "Dear Heart."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">(Guitar) When I was dreaming, I took my body to beautiful places I'd never been.</s>
 <s id="71">I saw Gibraltar, and stars of Kentucky burned in the moonlight, making me smile.</s>
 <s id="72">And when I awoke here, the sky was so cloudy.</s>
 <s id="73">I walked to a party where people I know try hard to know me and ask where I've been, but I can't explain what I've seen to them.</s>
 <s id="74">Ah, listen, dear heart.</s>
 <s id="75">Just pay attention, go right from the start.</s>
 <s id="76">Ah, listen, dear heart.</s>
 <s id="77">You can fall off the map, but don't fall apart.</s>
 <s id="78">Ooh ooh ooh, ah ah ah ah ah.</s>
 <s id="79">Ah ah, ah ah ah.</s>
 <s id="80">When I was out there, the ocean would hold me, rock me and throw me, light as a child.</s>
 <s id="81">But now I'm so heavy, nothing consoles me.</s>
 <s id="82">My mind floats like driftwood, wayward and wild.</s>
 <s id="83">Ah, listen, dear heart.</s>
 <s id="84">Just pay attention, go right from the start.</s>
 <s id="85">Ah, listen, dear heart.</s>
 <s id="86">You can fall off the map, but don't fall apart.</s>
 <s id="87">Ooh.</s>
 <s id="88">Eventually, Tori starts to get her feet under her.</s>
 <s id="89">She starts hanging out with her friends again.</s>
 <s id="90">She meets a guy and falls in love for the first time.</s>
 <s id="91">She gets a new job working for another Louisville native, Muhammad Ali.</s>
 <s id="92">One day, at lunch with her new boss, Tori shares the news that two other women are setting out to row across the mid-Atlantic, to do something that she almost died trying to do.</s>
 <s id="93">His response was classic Ali: "You don't want to go through life as the woman who almost rowed across the ocean."</s>
 <s id="94">He was right.</s>
 <s id="95">Tori rebuilt the American Pearl, and in December of 1999, she did it.</s>
 <s id="96">(Applause) (Guitar) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="97">(Applause)</s>
