 <s id="1">Recently, my daughter and I decided to give away some toys she no longer used.</s>
 <s id="2">She's six years old, and asked me for a camera to take a picture of them.</s>
 <s id="3">It was easier for her to farewell her toys if she could take a picture before giving them away.</s>
 <s id="4">Because she doesn't want to forget them.</s>
 <s id="5">Because pictures help us remember.</s>
 <s id="6">We grab our cell phones to snap when we feel something is special.</s>
 <s id="7">When something moves us, we feel the urge to capture what we feel and keep it in an image, in a picture.</s>
 <s id="8">However, we don't print photos on paper like we used to do, we share them in social networks, or we upload them to the cloud.</s>
 <s id="9">Photography turned into something intangible, something virtual.</s>
 <s id="10">But, what happens when we lose or erase our digital photos?</s>
 <s id="11">Those in your computer, in that hard disk or in your phone.</s>
 <s id="12">Is there anybody here who never lost a photo?</s>
 <s id="13">What would happen if, for some reason we would lose all of our parents' photos or other loved ones who are no longer with us?</s>
 <s id="14">How are we to remember them?</s>
 <s id="15">Going back to our photos from the past is like opening the doors to a dimension where lots of memories we seem to forget still remain.</s>
 <s id="16">And those images from the past, those cherished treasures can help us propel ourselves into the future, as well.</s>
 <s id="17">I am a nighttime photographer.</s>
 <s id="18">I make portraits under moonlight, in nature, close to the water.</s>
 <s id="19">I ask the people I photograph to remain still and silent for several minutes amidst darkness.</s>
 <s id="20">Meanwhile, I walk around them to light them up and light up the landscape with lanterns.</s>
 <s id="21">It's a moment of quietness and connection.</s>
 <s id="22">I went off to live in the islands of the Paraná River Delta for two years.</s>
 <s id="23">I took with me an old camera without knowing very well where I was going, neither what was I to find there.</s>
 <s id="24">And in time I came to know the islanders, and I invited them to be photographed under the full moon to recreate their daily life routines and jobs, but at night.</s>
 <s id="25">And I took photos of loggers, hunters and dreamers.</s>
 <s id="26">People living in isolation, whose only direct relationship is with water, to the rhythm of the river highs and lows.</s>
 <s id="27">And that visual work in the Delta led me to travel around the world, and took me to Japan.</s>
 <s id="28">I was searching for a new story to tell.</s>
 <s id="29">I wanted to work again with a community which had some connection with water.</s>
 <s id="30">And it happened that the curator of my exhibition, Ihiro Hayami, had relatives in a small fisher town and went with me for a visit.</s>
 <s id="31">Ōtsuchi is located between the mountains and the sea.</s>
 <s id="32">It's a fifteen-thousand-people town that in March 2011 went through the worst tragedy in its history.</s>
 <s id="33">It was washed off by a tsunami with waves tall as a five-story building.</s>
 <s id="34">Even though the alarms went off many people didn't believe it would be so strong, and remain in their homes.</s>
 <s id="35">As a consequence many people died, close to a 10 percent of the population.</s>
 <s id="36">And 70 percent of houses were washed away.</s>
 <s id="37">This is why every local in Ōtsuchi has either friends or family who died in the tsunami.</s>
 <s id="38">The power of the waves pulled the houses off their base and the sea gulped them up.</s>
 <s id="39">Survivors were left with no shelter and had to endure a winter with temperatures below zero Celsius.</s>
 <s id="40">Amidst this chaos and total destruction many people were trying to save their family photos.</s>
 <s id="41">An officer of Japan's Self Defense Forces recovers a photo album inside a house in total ruin.</s>
 <s id="42">There it was the picture of a child.</s>
 <s id="43">The officer holds the album as if he were holding the child.</s>
 <s id="44">I traveled to Ōtsuchi with my daughter who was five month old at the time.</s>
 <s id="45">And the contrast of a baby in the middle of such desolation was impressive.</s>
 <s id="46">People would take her off of my arms in order to kiss her.</s>
 <s id="47">And I'd wonder how to tell this story that happened a year and a half ago.</s>
 <s id="48">What could be positive out of such level of destruction.</s>
 <s id="49">The first thing I found were big piles of rubble made of all kind of things.</s>
 <s id="50">Twisted objects that speak about life as it used to be in Ōtsuchi.</s>
 <s id="51">Like this vending machine or this fishing elements, car remains ...</s>
 <s id="52">or what's left of a house.</s>
 <s id="53">A lamp turned into a Moebius strip, the symbol of infinite time.</s>
 <s id="54">As a contrast to these mountains of rubble there was this town flattened by water.</s>
 <s id="55">The skeletons of the houses, marked on the ground were empty spaces, filled with stories.</s>
 <s id="56">So I invited the survivors to go back to those spaces where their houses or workplaces used to exist.</s>
 <s id="57">And many accepted, but in general, the kids didn't want to.</s>
 <s id="58">I photographed them during the night as they remained silent and still during the ten minutes each photo took.</s>
 <s id="59">The scenes were so sad, nothing had color.</s>
 <s id="60">She is Haruko Okano, a librarian, and she's sitting on the remains of Ōtsuchi's Library, where she worked.</s>
 <s id="61">This is the Second Volunteers Firefighters Squad of Ōtsuchi inside of what was the fire station.</s>
 <s id="62">The fireman standing up was in charge of closing the anti-tsunami gates.</s>
 <s id="63">This is Yoshihiro Ogayu, monk of Kogan-ji temple.</s>
 <s id="64">The temple was a refuge in case of tsunami but even so it was destroyed.</s>
 <s id="65">His dad and his son died there.</s>
 <s id="66">When that first trip to Ōtsuchi was over I found a photo album in the middle of the street.</s>
 <s id="67">It had laid there for a year and a half without having anyone pick it up.</s>
 <s id="68">It was all wet, heavy and it stank just like a dead animal.</s>
 <s id="69">It was tainted with color bubbles gushing from the photos that blended together.</s>
 <s id="70">I took a picture of it without giving it much of a thought and I came back.</s>
 <s id="71">Once in Buenos Aires, the Ōtsuchi experience felt much like a far away dream.</s>
 <s id="72">It filled me up with doubt: Why did I have to tell this story, if I came from the other end of the world?</s>
 <s id="73">What did it had to do with me?</s>
 <s id="74">Why had I photographed the survivors in black and white if the reference of my work is color?</s>
 <s id="75">And while I made myself these questions, my own life began to crumble.</s>
 <s id="76">Soon after breakup, my daughter's mother went off to live in another country.</s>
 <s id="77">So I took on myself Lara's upbringing, she was a one-year-old baby.</s>
 <s id="78">Project Ōtsuchi was put on hold, because now it was me the one who had to survive and reinvent myself.</s>
 <s id="79">And some months later, revisiting the work the family photo album image popped up again.</s>
 <s id="80">But in this second view I grasped it in a different way.</s>
 <s id="81">I thought I saw a painter's palette.</s>
 <s id="82">So I took the main colors of that album to create my own color palette.</s>
 <s id="83">And I used those colors created by the force of the tsunami to color the images of the survivors.</s>
 <s id="84">And little by little, all the gray scenes turned into something colorful.</s>
 <s id="85">I used color as a bridge to connect the present and the past, as the hub between their photos and mine.</s>
 <s id="86">Now I was feeling connected with Ōtsuchi once again.</s>
 <s id="87">Two years passed since until I was able to return to Japan to search for other recovered photos and find new colors to paint with.</s>
 <s id="88">There I met Mikio Komukai, a nice man who had this NGO that was recovering family photos to send them back to their owners.</s>
 <s id="89">And with his help and the permission of Ōtsuchi's government I gained access to that impressive archive of thousand of destroyed photos.</s>
 <s id="90">Contemplating those pictures I realized the intangible damage the people of Ōtsuchi were facing; the damage to their memory and identity.</s>
 <s id="91">Those blurred images were the measure of their loss.</s>
 <s id="92">The firefighters of Ōtsuchi.</s>
 <s id="93">I traveled a total of six times to finish the project and publish a book.</s>
 <s id="94">And this is the last picture I took with my two assistants, Mayumi Suzuki and Kazuhiko Chikaoka, who both lost their parents to the tsunami.</s>
 <s id="95">We built an arch with plastic tubes which they arranged in different positions over the remains of this house.</s>
 <s id="96">And if you look carefully at the photo you will see that their hands are holding this house of light.</s>
 <s id="97">In 2016 the government of Ōtsuchi invited me to show my project, but I had a feeling that it was not over.</s>
 <s id="98">There was something left to do.</s>
 <s id="99">So I suggested that we put together a collective exhibition which we set up in the gymnasium of a temporary school.</s>
 <s id="100">And we invited high school students and the people in town to take photos.</s>
 <s id="101">Now the kids did want to join in.</s>
 <s id="102">We gave them disposable cameras with one assignment: to tell their lives in pictures, their intimate whereabouts.</s>
 <s id="103">Five years away from the tsunami there were children back in the streets taking photos, recording its life.</s>
 <s id="104">And together, in community, we created a small photo archive of what Ōtsuchi is today.</s>
 <s id="105">The people in town took pictures to create new memories: The memories of the future of Ōtsuchi.</s>
 <s id="106">As for me, I started my own photo album telling my life and my travels with Lara.</s>
 <s id="107">And here we are in Japan, saying goodbye to the sea of Ōtsuchi.</s>
 <s id="108">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="109">(Applause)</s>
