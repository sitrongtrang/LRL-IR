 <s id="1">The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.</s>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">Which is, you go onto a stage.</s>
  <s id="2.2">There is an orchestra sitting.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="3">They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.</s>
 <s id="4">And I go on the podium.</s>
 <s id="5">You know, this little office of the conductor.</s>
 <s id="6">Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle, with a lot of space.</s>
 <s id="7">And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture.</s>
 <s id="8">Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.</s>
 <s id="9">And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.</s>
 <s id="10">Noise becomes music.</s>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">And this is fantastic.</s>
  <s id="11.2">And it's so tempting to think that it's all about me.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">(Laughter) All those great people here, virtuosos, they make noise, they need me to do that.</s>
 <p id="p13">
  <s id="13.1">Not really.</s>
  <s id="13.2">If it were that, I would just save you the talk, and teach you the gesture.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p14">
  <s id="14.1">So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony.</s>
  <s id="14.2">It doesn't work.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="15">Let's look at the first video.</s>
 <s id="16">I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.</s>
 <s id="17">And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.</s>
 <s id="18">(Music) Was that nice?</s>
 <s id="19">So that was a sort of a success.</s>
 <s id="20">Now, who should we thank for the success?</s>
 <s id="21">I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians playing beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.</s>
 <s id="22">They don't often even look at the conductor.</s>
 <s id="23">Then you have the clapping audience, yeah, actually taking part in doing the music.</s>
 <s id="24">You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.</s>
 <s id="25">This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast that you will ever get in Vienna.</s>
 <s id="26">(Laughter) Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.</s>
 <s id="27">You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.</s>
 <s id="28">In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) So that's a sort of a tradition.</s>
 <s id="30">But Viennese audiences do not do that.</s>
 <s id="31">Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.</s>
 <s id="32">You know, audiences like you, yeah, make the event.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">But what about the conductor?</s>
  <s id="33.2">What can you say the conductor was doing, actually?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">Um, he was happy.</s>
 <s id="35">And I often show this to senior management.</s>
 <s id="36">People get annoyed.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">"You come to work.</s>
  <s id="37.2">How come you're so happy?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p38">
  <s id="38.1">Something must be wrong there, yeah?</s>
  <s id="38.2">But he's spreading happiness.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="39">And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music.</s>
 <s id="40">The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.</s>
 <s id="41">You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">You have the story of the audience as a community.</s>
  <s id="42.2">Yeah.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience.</s>
 <s id="44">And then you have other stories, unseen.</s>
 <s id="45">People who build this wonderful concert hall.</s>
 <s id="46">People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.</s>
 <s id="47">And all those stories are being heard at the same time.</s>
 <s id="48">This is the true experience of a live concert.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">That's a reason to go out of home.</s>
  <s id="49.2">Yeah?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="50">And not all conductors do just that.</s>
 <s id="51">Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.</s>
 <s id="52">Riccardo Muti, please.</s>
 <p id="p53">
  <s id="53.1">(Music) Yeah, that was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure.</s>
  <s id="53.2">Right?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p54">
  <s id="54.1">He's awesome.</s>
  <s id="54.2">He's so commanding.</s>
  <s id="54.3">Yeah?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">So clear.</s>
  <s id="55.2">Maybe a little bit over-clear.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">Can we have a little demonstration?</s>
  <s id="56.2">Would you be my orchestra for a second?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?</s>
 <s id="58">You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">Okay?</s>
  <s id="59.2">Ready?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫ Itay Talgam: Come on, with me.</s>
  <s id="60.2">If you do it without me I feel even more redundant than I already feel.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="61">So please, wait for the conductor.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">Now look at me.</s>
  <s id="62.2">"Aaaaaah," and I stop you.</s>
  <s id="62.3">Let's go.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p63">
  <s id="63.1">Audience: ♫ ...</s>
  <s id="63.2">Aaaaaaaah ... ♫ (Laughter) Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">(Laughter) But ...</s>
  <s id="64.2">There is a vacancy for a ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">But -- (Laughter) -- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">Now what does Riccardo Muti do?</s>
  <s id="66.2">He does something like this ...</s>
 </p>
 <s id="67">(Laughter) And then -- sort of -- (Laughter) So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.</s>
 <p id="p68">
  <s id="68.1">(Laughter) So, does it work?</s>
  <s id="68.2">Yes, it works -- to a certain point.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="69">When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"</s>
 <s id="70">He says, "I'm responsible."</s>
 <s id="71">Responsible in front of him.</s>
 <p id="p72">
  <s id="72.1">No he doesn't really mean Him.</s>
  <s id="72.2">He means Mozart, which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="73">(Laughter) So he says, "If I'm -- (Applause) if I'm responsible for Mozart, this is going to be the only story to be told.</s>
 <s id="74">It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."</s>
 <s id="75">And you know what happened to Muti?</s>
 <p id="p76">
  <s id="76.1">Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, "You're a great conductor.</s>
  <s id="76.2">We don't want to work with you.</s>
  <s id="76.3">Please resign."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p77">
  <s id="77.1">(Laughter) "Why?</s>
  <s id="77.2">Because you don't let us develop.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="78">You're using us as instruments, not as partners.</s>
 <s id="79">And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."</s>
 <p id="p80">
  <s id="80.1">So he had to resign.</s>
  <s id="80.2">Isn't that nice?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p81">
  <s id="81.1">(Laughter) He's a nice guy.</s>
  <s id="81.2">He's a really nice guy.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="82">Well, can you do it with less control, or with a different kind of control?</s>
 <s id="83">Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.</s>
 <s id="84">(Music) I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">It's not true.</s>
  <s id="85.2">When he was a young man of about 30, he wrote what he called "The Ten Commandments for Conductors."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert it means that you must have done something wrong.</s>
 <p id="p87">
  <s id="87.1">That's the first one.</s>
  <s id="87.2">The fourth one you'll like better.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="88">It says: Never look at the trombones -- it only encourages them.</s>
 <s id="89">(Laughter) So, the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself.</s>
 <s id="90">Do not interfere.</s>
 <p id="p91">
  <s id="91.1">But how does it happen?</s>
  <s id="91.2">Did you see him turning pages in the score?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="92">Now, either he is senile, and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.</s>
 <p id="p93">
  <s id="93.1">Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying, "Come on guys.</s>
  <s id="93.2">You have to play by the book.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p94">
  <s id="94.1">So it's not about my story.</s>
  <s id="94.2">It's not about your story.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="95">It's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation."</s>
 <s id="96">Interpretation is the real story of the performer.</s>
 <p id="p97">
  <s id="97.1">So, no, he doesn't want that.</s>
  <s id="97.2">That's a different kind of control.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p98">
  <s id="98.1">Let's see another super-conductor, a German super-conductor.</s>
  <s id="98.2">Herbert von Karajan, please.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p99">
  <s id="99.1">(Music) What's different?</s>
  <s id="99.2">Did you see the eyes?</s>
  <s id="99.3">Closed.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="100">Did you see the hands?</s>
 <p id="p101">
  <s id="101.1">Did you see this kind of movement?</s>
  <s id="101.2">Let me conduct you.</s>
  <s id="101.3">Twice.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="102">Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.</s>
 <p id="p103">
  <s id="103.1">And then like Karajan.</s>
  <s id="103.2">Let's see what happens.</s>
  <s id="103.3">Okay?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p104">
  <s id="104.1">Like Muti.</s>
  <s id="104.2">You ready?</s>
  <s id="104.3">Because Muti ...</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p105">
  <s id="105.1">(Laughter) Okay?</s>
  <s id="105.2">Ready?</s>
  <s id="105.3">Let's do it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="106">Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.</s>
 <p id="p107">
  <s id="107.1">Audience: (Claps) Itay Talgam: Good.</s>
  <s id="107.2">Now like a Karajan.</s>
  <s id="107.3">Since you're already trained, let me concentrate, close my eyes.</s>
  <s id="107.4">Come, come.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p108">
  <s id="108.1">Audience: (Claps) (Laughter) Itay Talgam: Why not together?</s>
  <s id="108.2">(Laughter) Because you didn't know when to play.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="109">Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic doesn't know when to play.</s>
 <p id="p110">
  <s id="110.1">(Laughter) But I'll tell you how they do it.</s>
  <s id="110.2">No cynicism.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="111">This is a German orchestra, yes?</s>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">They look at Karajan.</s>
  <s id="112.2">And then they look at each other.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">(Laughter) "Do you understand what this guy wants?"</s>
 <s id="114">And after doing that, they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.</s>
 <s id="115">And when Karajan is asked about it he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear instruction.</s>
 <s id="116">Because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that is needed for an orchestra."</s>
 <p id="p117">
  <s id="117.1">Now that's great.</s>
  <s id="117.2">What about the eyes?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="118">Why are the eyes closed?</s>
 <s id="119">There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.</s>
 <s id="120">And he cues in a flute player like this.</s>
 <p id="p121">
  <s id="121.1">The guy has no idea what to do.</s>
  <s id="121.2">(Laughter) "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p122">
  <s id="122.1">What do you think Karajan's reply was?</s>
  <s id="122.2">When should I start?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p123">
  <s id="123.1">Oh yeah.</s>
  <s id="123.2">He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="124">(Laughter) Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.</s>
 <p id="p125">
  <s id="125.1">It's my music.</s>
  <s id="125.2">The real music is only in Karajan's head.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p126">
  <s id="126.1">And you have to guess my mind.</s>
  <s id="126.2">So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you instruction, and yet, you have to guess my mind.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="127">So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet very firm control.</s>
 <p id="p128">
  <s id="128.1">Can we do it in another way?</s>
  <s id="128.2">Of course we can.</s>
  <s id="128.3">Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen: Carlos Kleiber, his name.</s>
  <s id="128.4">Next video, please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="129">(Music) (Laughter) Yeah.</s>
 <p id="p130">
  <s id="130.1">Well, it is different.</s>
  <s id="130.2">But isn't that controlling in the same way?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="131">No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.</s>
 <p id="p132">
  <s id="132.1">When he does this, it's not, "Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix, smash it on the floor."</s>
  <s id="132.2">It's not that.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="133">He says, "This is the gesture of the music.</s>
 <s id="134">I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation."</s>
 <s id="135">That is another story.</s>
 <s id="136">But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions?</s>
 <p id="p137">
  <s id="137.1">It's like being on a rollercoaster.</s>
  <s id="137.2">Yeah?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="138">You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.</s>
 <s id="139">That's what he does.</s>
 <s id="140">The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.</s>
 <p id="p141">
  <s id="141.1">It's not a physical thing.</s>
  <s id="141.2">It's in the players' heads.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="142">And that's what makes them into partners.</s>
 <s id="143">You have the plan in your head.</s>
 <s id="144">You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.</s>
 <p id="p145">
  <s id="145.1">But here and there and that.</s>
  <s id="145.2">You know what to do.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="146">And you become a partner building the rollercoaster, yeah, with sound, as you actually take the ride.</s>
 <s id="147">This is very exciting for those players.</s>
 <s id="148">They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.</s>
 <p id="p149">
  <s id="149.1">(Laughter) It is very tiring.</s>
  <s id="149.2">Yeah?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="150">But it's the best music making, like this.</s>
 <s id="151">But of course it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.</s>
 <s id="152">You also have to be very professional.</s>
 <s id="153">And look again at this Kleiber.</s>
 <s id="154">Can we have the next video, quickly?</s>
 <s id="155">You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.</s>
 <s id="156">(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.</s>
 <s id="157">(Music) And now there is a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done.</s>
 <p id="p158">
  <s id="158.1">Go along with the video.</s>
  <s id="158.2">Look.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="159">See, second time for the same player.</s>
 <s id="160">(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.</s>
 <s id="161">(Laughter) "Wait for me after the concert.</s>
 <s id="162">I have a short notice to give you."</s>
 <p id="p163">
  <s id="163.1">You know, when it's needed, the authority is there.</s>
  <s id="163.2">It's very important.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="164">But authority is not enough to make people your partners.</s>
 <p id="p165">
  <s id="165.1">Let's see the next video, please.</s>
  <s id="165.2">See what happens here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="166">You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy.</s>
 <s id="167">He's conducting Mozart.</s>
 <s id="168">(Music) The whole orchestra is playing.</s>
 <s id="169">(Music) Now something else.</s>
 <p id="p170">
  <s id="170.1">(Music) See?</s>
  <s id="170.2">He is there 100 percent, but not commanding, not telling what to do.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="171">Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.</s>
 <p id="p172">
  <s id="172.1">(Music) Another solo now.</s>
  <s id="172.2">See what you can pick up from this.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="173">(Music) Look at the eyes.</s>
 <p id="p174">
  <s id="174.1">Okay.</s>
  <s id="174.2">You see that?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="175">First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.</s>
 <p id="p176">
  <s id="176.1">It's not feedback.</s>
  <s id="176.2">It's an "Mmmm ..."</s>
  <s id="176.3">Yeah, it comes from here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="177">So that's a good thing.</s>
 <s id="178">And the second thing is it's about actually being in control, but in a very special way.</s>
 <p id="p179">
  <s id="179.1">When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes, going from here?</s>
  <s id="179.2">(Singing) You know what happens?</s>
  <s id="179.3">Gravitation is no more.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="180">Kleiber not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.</s>
 <s id="181">So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous and therefore happy and proud of his work, and creative and all of that.</s>
 <s id="182">And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.</s>
 <s id="183">So control is no longer a zero-sum game.</s>
 <p id="p184">
  <s id="184.1">You have this control.</s>
  <s id="184.2">You have this control.</s>
  <s id="184.3">And all you put together, in partnership, brings about the best music.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="185">So Kleiber is about process.</s>
 <s id="186">Kleiber is about conditions in the world.</s>
 <s id="187">But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.</s>
 <s id="188">Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.</s>
 <p id="p189">
  <s id="189.1">Since he was a great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning.</s>
  <s id="189.2">Look at this, please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="190">(Music) Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?</s>
 <s id="191">Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.</s>
 <s id="192">(Laughter) Did you see Lenny's face?</s>
 <p id="p193">
  <s id="193.1">You know why?</s>
  <s id="193.2">Because the meaning of the music is pain.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="194">And you're playing a painful sound.</s>
 <s id="195">And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.</s>
 <s id="196">But not in a way that you want to stop.</s>
 <s id="197">It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.</s>
 <s id="198">(Laughter) But you can see the music on his face.</s>
 <p id="p199">
  <s id="199.1">You can see the baton left his hand.</s>
  <s id="199.2">No more baton.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="200">Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.</s>
 <p id="p201">
  <s id="201.1">Now it's a reversed thing.</s>
  <s id="201.2">You're telling the story.</s>
  <s id="201.3">And you're telling the story.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="202">And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community, listens to.</s>
 <p id="p203">
  <s id="203.1">And Bernstein enables that.</s>
  <s id="203.2">Isn't that wonderful?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="204">Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.</s>
 <s id="205">And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.</s>
 <p id="p206">
  <s id="206.1">My friend Peter says, "If you love something, give it away."</s>
  <s id="206.2">So, please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="207">(Music) (Applause)</s>
