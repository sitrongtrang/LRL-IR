 <s id="1">In many ways, our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future.</s>
 <s id="2">And for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits.</s>
 <s id="3">Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states for two possible values, 0 and 1.</s>
 <s id="4">Files and programs consist of millions of these bits, all processed in the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain.</s>
 <s id="5">And as the number of bits needing to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed.</s>
 <s id="6">Like us, computers have short-term memory for immediate tasks, and long-term memory for more permanent storage.</s>
 <s id="7">When you run a program, your operating system allocates area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions.</s>
 <s id="8">For example, when you press a key in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations to retrieve bits of data.</s>
 <s id="9">It could also modify them, or create new ones.</s>
 <s id="10">The time this takes is known as the memory's latency.</s>
 <s id="11">And because program instructions must be processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory.</s>
 <s id="12">The most common type of RAM is dynamic RAM, or DRAM.</s>
 <s id="13">There, each memory cell consists of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge, or a 1 when charged.</s>
 <s id="14">Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging to retain data.</s>
 <s id="15">But even its low latency of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM.</s>
 <s id="16">That's usually made up of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing.</s>
 <s id="17">SRAM is the fastest memory in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times more space than DRAM.</s>
 <s id="18">But RAM and cache can only hold data as long as they're powered.</s>
 <s id="19">For data to remain once the device is turned off, it must be transferred into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types.</s>
 <s id="20">In magnetic storage, which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.</s>
 <s id="21">But because the disc must rotate to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 times slower than that of DRAM.</s>
 <s id="22">On the other hand, optical-based storage like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating.</s>
 <s id="23">Bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by a laser.</s>
 <s id="24">While optical storage media are cheap and removable, they have even slower latencies than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well.</s>
 <s id="25">Finally, the newest and fastest types of long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks.</s>
 <s id="26">These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping or removing electrical charges within their specially designed internal structures.</s>
 <s id="27">So how reliable are these billions of bits?</s>
 <s id="28">We tend to think of computer memory as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly.</s>
 <s id="29">The heat generated from a device and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage in floating gates.</s>
 <s id="30">Solid-state drives also have an additional weakness.</s>
 <s id="31">Repeatedly writing to floating gate transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless.</s>
 <s id="32">With data on most current storage media having less than a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable.</s>
 <s id="33">For now, immortality remains out of reach, for humans and computers alike.</s>
