  <s id="1.1">Hello, everyone.</s>
  <s id="1.2">Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p2">
  <s id="2.1">Yes.</s>
  <s id="2.2">That's right.</s>
  <s id="2.3">This is Barbie.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">She's 50 years old.</s>
  <s id="3.2">And she's looking as young as ever.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face.</s>
 <p id="p5">
  <s id="5.1">This is Fulla.</s>
  <s id="5.2">Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="6">Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.</s>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">They have different interests.</s>
  <s id="7.2">They have divergent values.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">And should they ever come in contact ...</s>
 <s id="9">well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.</s>
 <s id="10">My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.</s>
 <s id="11">Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic.</s>
 <s id="12">I want to show you two examples.</s>
 <s id="13">The first is 4Shbab.</s>
 <s id="14">It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.</s>
 <s id="15">(Video): Video clips from across the globe.</s>
 <s id="16">The USA.</s>
 <s id="17">♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ ♫ Everything will be all right ♫ ♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫ The Arab world.</s>
 <s id="18">(Music) ♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫ Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.</s>
 <s id="19">Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Haïba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives.</s>
 <s id="20">He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.</s>
 <s id="21">4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels.</s>
 <s id="22">And they look something like this.</s>
 <p id="p23">
  <s id="23.1">(Music) That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe.</s>
  <s id="23.2">She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="24">In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.</s>
 <s id="25">But it's not about fire and brimstone either.</s>
 <s id="26">Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges.</s>
 <s id="27">Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.</s>
 <s id="28">And it's called "The 99."</s>
 <s id="29">Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.</s>
 <s id="30">They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa.</s>
 <s id="31">And his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.</s>
 <p id="p32">
  <s id="32.1">"The 99."</s>
  <s id="32.2">The characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="33">So, for example, there is the character of Noora.</s>
 <s id="34">She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone.</s>
 <s id="35">Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions.</s>
 <s id="36">Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.</s>
 <s id="37">It's now a theme park.</s>
 <s id="38">There is an animated series in the works.</s>
 <s id="39">And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever they find it.</s>
 <s id="40">"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.</s>
 <s id="41">We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.</s>
 <s id="42">Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.</s>
 <s id="43">I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.</s>
 <s id="44">Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of this.</s>
 <s id="45">Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both ancient and modern.</s>
 <s id="46">After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: "We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another."</s>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed.</s>
  <s id="47.2">Thank you.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="48">(Applause)</s>
