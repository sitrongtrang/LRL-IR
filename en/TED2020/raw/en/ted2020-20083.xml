 <s id="1">I first tried online dating my freshman year of college, which was in 2001, in case you can't see my wrinkle.</s>
 <s id="2">Now, as you may have noticed, I'm six-feet tall, and when I arrived at my chosen university and realized our men's Division III basketball team averaged five-foot-eight, I abandoned the on-campus scene and went online.</s>
 <s id="3">Now, back then, online dating was pretty close to the plot of "You've Got Mail."</s>
 <s id="4">You'd write long emails back and forth for weeks, before you finally met up in real life.</s>
 <s id="5">Except, in my case, you'd realize you have no chemistry and so now, you're back to square one.</s>
 <s id="6">So, while online dating has changed a lot in the last 17 years, many of the frustrations remain the same.</s>
 <s id="7">Because here's what it does well.</s>
 <s id="8">It broadens your pool of potential dates beyond your existing social and professional circles.</s>
 <s id="9">And here's what it doesn't do well.</s>
 <s id="10">Literally everything else.</s>
 <s id="11">(Laughter) A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA.</s>
 <s id="12">So, when things aren't working out, I tend to take a step back, apply my business toolkit to figure out why, and to fix it.</s>
 <s id="13">My love life was no exception.</s>
 <s id="14">The summer before I turned 30, I took myself on a relationship off-site.</s>
 <s id="15">Which means I went camping solo in Maine for a week, to do a retro on my track record of mediocre relationships.</s>
 <s id="16">Because the thing was, I knew what I wanted in a partner.</s>
 <s id="17">Kindness, curiosity, empathy, a sense of purpose.</s>
 <s id="18">And yet, here's what I chose for online: Ivy League degree, six feet or taller, lives within 12 subway stops of me.</s>
 <s id="19">It's not that I intentionally prioritized those things, it's just the easiest to vet for online.</s>
 <s id="20">It kind of is like a résumé review, which is why these guys looked great on paper and never quite fit me.</s>
 <s id="21">So when I went back online in the spring of 2016, I decided to reengineer the process through some classic business tools.</s>
 <s id="22">First, I went to OkCupid, because I wanted to avoid the gamification of swipe-based apps.</s>
 <s id="23">And also, because I wanted a writing sample.</s>
 <s id="24">Next, I set up a sales funnel, throwing out any sense of my type, and instead defining the criteria that would qualify a lead.</s>
 <s id="25">An inbound message had to do three things: had to be written in complete sentences and with good grammar; it had to reference something in my profile, so I know it's not a copy-and-paste situation; and it had to avoid all sexual content.</s>
 <s id="26">I figured this was a pretty low bar, but it turns out, of my 210 inbound messages, only 14 percent cleared that hurdle.</s>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) Next, I wanted to meet in real life as quickly as possible, because the things I cared about, I couldn't see online.</s>
 <s id="28">But the research, and my experience, shows you only need about 30 seconds with someone to tell if you click.</s>
 <s id="29">So I invented the zero date.</s>
 <s id="30">The zero date is one drink, one hour.</s>
 <s id="31">With the goal of answering one question: Would I like to have dinner with this person?</s>
 <s id="32">Not "are they the one"?</s>
 <s id="33">Literally, "Would I like to spend three hours across the table from this person?"</s>
 <s id="34">You tell them you have a hard stop -- drinks with girlfriends, a conference call with China -- it doesn't matter, they don't know you.</s>
 <s id="35">The point is one hour.</s>
 <s id="36">If it's awesome, you schedule a first date.</s>
 <s id="37">And if it's not awesome, you downshift into entertainer mode and you workshop a few new stories for your next networking event.</s>
 <s id="38">Plus, because it's just an hour, you can squeeze up to three in one evening and then you only have to do your hair and pick out one great outfit a week.</s>
 <s id="39">The zero date also gave me a chance to see how they responded to me asking them out.</s>
 <s id="40">I figured not everyone would dig my moxie, and I was right.</s>
 <s id="41">Of my 29 qualified leads, only 15 replied to my message, and of those, six scheduled a zero date.</s>
 <s id="42">My first zero date was with a set designer.</s>
 <s id="43">And we were both into yoga and preferred our bagels with peanut butter, so it looked pretty promising.</s>
 <s id="44">But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.</s>
 <s id="45">After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.</s>
 <s id="46">But we had agreed to meet on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade with a flask of whiskey to watch the sunset, and honestly, it was two blocks from my apartment.</s>
 <s id="47">Plus, this guy had a podcast, I have a podcast, worst case scenario, we can talk about our podcasts.</s>
 <s id="48">Then, Chas set down next to me.</s>
 <s id="49">And this kind and empathetic man told great jokes and asked even better questions.</s>
 <s id="50">He was a lawyer and a writer, and his eyes twinkled when he laughed and they squeezed tight when I kissed him and at some point in the evening, our zero date became a first date.</s>
 <s id="51">And two years later, we have a washer, dryer and two house plants together.</s>
 <s id="52">Now, I can't promise you're going to end up with house plants.</s>
 <s id="53">But the point of this story is that online dating doesn't have to suck.</s>
 <s id="54">Don't treat it like a game, and don't treat it like a resume review.</s>
 <s id="55">Instead, use it to source and qualify leads and then get offline as quickly as possible with the zero date.</s>
 <s id="56">Because the point of this isn't swiping.</s>
 <s id="57">It's finding your person.</s>
 <s id="58">Good luck.</s>
 <s id="59">(Applause)</s>
