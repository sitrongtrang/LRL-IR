 <s id="1">What I want to talk to you about today is virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.</s>
 <s id="2">What does this all mean for us?</s>
 <s id="3">What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.</s>
 <s id="4">It's going to become super exciting as we transform to this highly immersive and interactive world.</s>
 <s id="5">With graphics, computing power, low latencies, these types of applications and possibilities are going to stream rich data into your lives.</s>
 <s id="6">So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives, are all about extending our current search metaphor.</s>
 <s id="7">When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web, remembering URLs, saving favorites.</s>
 <s id="8">As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings, the Web matching, the index crawling.</s>
 <s id="9">But we want to use our brain!</s>
 <s id="10">We want to navigate, explore, discover information.</s>
 <s id="11">In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.</s>
 <s id="12">We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.</s>
 <s id="13">So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?</s>
 <s id="14">Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?</s>
 <s id="15">So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.</s>
 <s id="16">What we want to do is mix in all types of data.</s>
 <p id="p17">
  <s id="17.1">Tag it.</s>
  <s id="17.2">Attribute it.</s>
  <s id="17.3">Metadata.</s>
  <s id="17.4">Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p18">
  <s id="18.1">So when you think about this problem, what an enormous undertaking.</s>
  <s id="18.2">Where do you begin?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="19">Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes, from ground vehicles, from people.</s>
 <s id="20">This process is an engineering problem, a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.</s>
 <s id="21">Here is an example of our aerial camera.</s>
 <p id="p22">
  <s id="22.1">This is panchromatic.</s>
  <s id="22.2">It's actually four color cones.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="23">In addition, it's multi-spectral.</s>
 <s id="24">We collect four gigabits per second of data, if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.</s>
 <s id="25">That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.</s>
 <s id="26">We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">You can see the camera on the front.</s>
  <s id="27.2">We collect multiple viewpoints, vantage points, angles, textures.</s>
  <s id="27.3">We bring all that data back in.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p28">
  <s id="28.1">We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale -- what do you see in person?</s>
  <s id="28.2">We need to capture that up close to establish that what it's like-type experience.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="29">I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials, kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.</s>
 <s id="30">So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">The poor PC guy.</s>
  <s id="31.2">They're duct taping his head.</s>
  <s id="31.3">They're just wrapping it on him.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">(Laughter).</s>
  <s id="33.2">So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job.</s>
 <s id="35">We think a lot of good can come from this technology.</s>
 <p id="p36">
  <s id="36.1">This was after Katrina.</s>
  <s id="36.2">We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">We flew the area.</s>
  <s id="37.2">We imaged it.</s>
  <s id="37.3">We sent in people.</s>
  <s id="37.4">We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas.</s>
  <s id="37.5">We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="38">Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.</s>
 <s id="39">We made it all freely available on the Web, just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.</s>
 <s id="40">When we think about how all this comes together, it's all about software, algorithms and math.</s>
 <p id="p41">
  <s id="41.1">You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models we need to do geo-positioning.</s>
  <s id="41.2">We need to do geo-registering of the images.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">We have to bundle adjust them.</s>
  <s id="42.2">Find tie points.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">Extract geometry from the images.</s>
 <s id="44">This process is a very calculated process.</s>
 <s id="45">In fact, it was always done manual.</s>
 <s id="46">Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.</s>
 <s id="47">They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.</s>
 <p id="p48">
  <s id="48.1">They'd collected information with photos.</s>
  <s id="48.2">They'd manually build each building.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="49">We do this all through software, algorithms and math -- a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.</s>
 <s id="50">We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities, and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.</s>
 <s id="51">We think about the user interface.</s>
 <s id="52">What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?</s>
 <p id="p53">
  <s id="53.1">An ortho-view, a nadir-view.</s>
  <s id="53.2">How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="54">I'll wrap up by showing you the -- this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.</s>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">What we're doing is -- people like this a lot, this bird's eye imagery we work with.</s>
  <s id="55.2">It's this high resolution data.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="56">But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.</s>
 <s id="57">A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.</s>
 <s id="58">So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">You can see all types of resolution.</s>
  <s id="59.2">From here, I can slowly pan the image over.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">I can get the next image.</s>
  <s id="60.2">I can blend and transition.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">By doing this I don't lose the original detail.</s>
  <s id="61.2">In fact, I might be recording history.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">The freshness, the capacity.</s>
  <s id="62.2">I can turn this image.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.</s>
 <s id="64">What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.</s>
 <s id="65">We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with, and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.</s>
 <s id="66">I thank you very much for your time.</s>
 <s id="67">(Applause)</s>
