 <s id="1">One fine day, when Charles Darwin was still a student at Cambridge, the budding naturalist tore some old bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath.</s>
 <s id="2">He’d just taken one beetle in each hand when he spotted a third beetle.</s>
 <s id="3">Stashing one of the insects in his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, bitter fluid scalded his tongue.</s>
 <s id="4">Darwin’s assailant was the bombardier beetle.</s>
 <s id="5">It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals to defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid from glands in its abdomen.</s>
 <s id="6">But why doesn’t this caustic substance, ejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself?</s>
 <s id="7">In fact, how do any toxic animals survive their own secretions?</s>
 <s id="8">The answer is that they use one of two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them.</s>
 <s id="9">Bombardier beetles use the first approach.</s>
 <s id="10">They store ingredients for their poison in two separate chambers.</s>
 <s id="11">When they’re threatened, the valve between the chambers opens and the substances combine in a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray shooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that protects the beetle’s internal tissues.</s>
 <s id="12">Similarly, jellyfish package their venom safely in harpoon-like structures called nematocysts.</s>
 <s id="13">And venomous snakes store their flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments that only have one exit: through the fangs and into their prey or predator.</s>
 <s id="14">Snakes also employ the second strategy: built-in biochemical resistance.</s>
 <s id="15">Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers manufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom components in the blood.</s>
 <s id="16">Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also evolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism.</s>
 <s id="17">These tiny animals defend themselves using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming small arthropods like mites and ants.</s>
 <s id="18">One of their most potent alkaloids is the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors in the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger.</s>
 <s id="19">An amount barely heavier than a grain of sugar would kill you.</s>
 <s id="20">So what prevents poison frogs from poisoning themselves?</s>
 <s id="21">Think of the molecular target of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key.</s>
 <s id="22">When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical and electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death.</s>
 <s id="23">But if you change the shape of the lock, the key can’t fit.</s>
 <s id="24">For poison dart frogs and many other animals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter the structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin from exerting its adverse effects.</s>
 <s id="25">Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop this resistance: their predators and prey can, too.</s>
 <s id="26">The garter snake, which dines on neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance to salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes as the salamanders themselves.</s>
 <s id="27">That means that only the most toxic salamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes will survive the meal.</s>
 <s id="28">The result is that the genes providing the highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities to the next generations.</s>
 <s id="29">As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race that plays out over millions of years.</s>
 <s id="30">This pattern appears over and over again.</s>
 <s id="31">Grasshopper mice resist painful venom from scorpion prey through genetic changes in their nervous systems.</s>
 <s id="32">Horned lizards readily consume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting with specialized blood plasma.</s>
 <s id="33">And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation with compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses.</s>
 <s id="34">The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray that Darwin found so distasteful.</s>
 <s id="35">Most of the beetles are spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well.</s>
 <s id="36">But how do the toads survive the experience?</s>
 <s id="37">That is still a mystery.</s>
