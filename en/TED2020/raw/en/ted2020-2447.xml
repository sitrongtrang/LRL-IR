 <s id="1">I want to tell you the story about the time I almost got kidnapped in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.</s>
 <s id="2">It's the day after graduating from design school and I'm having a yard sale.</s>
 <s id="3">And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff.</s>
 <s id="4">And he buys a piece of art that I made.</s>
 <s id="5">And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps.</s>
 <s id="6">So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world.</s>
 <s id="7">Now it's starting to get late, and I'm getting pretty tired.</s>
 <s id="8">As I motion for the tab, I make the mistake of asking him, "So where are you staying tonight?"</s>
 <s id="9">And he makes it worse by saying, "Actually, I don't have a place."</s>
 <s id="10">And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"</s>
 <s id="11">What do you do?</s>
 <s id="12">We've all been there, right?</s>
 <s id="13">Do I offer to host this guy?</s>
 <s id="14">But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.</s>
 <s id="15">That's a small trunk!</s>
 <s id="16">So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."</s>
 <s id="17">And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"</s>
 <s id="18">That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done?</s>
 <s id="19">There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.</s>
 <s id="20">What if he's psychotic?"</s>
 <s id="21">My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door.</s>
 <s id="22">It turns out he was not psychotic.</s>
 <s id="23">We've kept in touch ever since.</s>
 <s id="24">And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.</s>
 <s id="25">This was my first hosting experience, and it completely changed my perspective.</s>
 <s id="26">Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered.</s>
 <s id="27">The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me and when I moved to San Francisco, I brought the airbed with me.</s>
 <s id="28">So now it's two years later.</s>
 <s id="29">I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.</s>
 <s id="30">And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town, and all the hotels are sold out.</s>
 <s id="31">And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity.</s>
 <s id="32">So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.</s>
 <s id="33">Ha!"</s>
 <s id="34">We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.</s>
 <s id="35">Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.</s>
 <s id="36">But they loved it, and so did we.</s>
 <s id="37">I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.</s>
 <s id="38">We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other.</s>
 <s id="39">Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?</s>
 <s id="40">The wheels had started to turn.</s>
 <s id="41">My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder.</s>
 <s id="42">And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business.</s>
 <s id="43">Here's what we pitched investors: "We want to build a website where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces, their bedrooms, the bathrooms -- the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.</s>
 <s id="44">And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.</s>
 <s id="45">It's going to be huge!"</s>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.</s>
 <s id="47">It did not.</s>
 <s id="48">No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.</s>
 <s id="49">Why?</s>
 <s id="50">Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.</s>
 <s id="51">Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design.</s>
 <s id="52">In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.</s>
 <s id="53">We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met.</s>
 <s id="54">Could design make that happen?</s>
 <s id="55">Is it possible to design for trust?</s>
 <s id="56">I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve.</s>
 <s id="57">I've got a 30-second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone.</s>
 <s id="58">If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.</s>
 <s id="59">OK, I need you to take out your phones.</s>
 <s id="60">Now that you have your phone out, I'd like you to unlock your phone.</s>
 <s id="61">Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.</s>
 <s id="62">(Laughter) That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now -- (Laughter) is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.</s>
 <s id="63">Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home.</s>
 <s id="64">People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</s>
 <s id="65">Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?</s>
 <s id="66">Most of us feel really responsible.</s>
 <s id="67">That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.</s>
 <s id="68">And it's because of this that our company can even exist.</s>
 <s id="69">By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?</s>
 <s id="70">(Laughter) Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?</s>
 <s id="71">(Laughter) (Applause) OK, you can hand your phones back now.</s>
 <s id="72">So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.</s>
 <s id="73">What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment?</s>
 <s id="74">What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?</s>
 <s id="75">Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"</s>
 <s id="76">(Laughter) Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?</s>
 <s id="77">It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.</s>
 <s id="78">And we didn't actually get it right the first time.</s>
 <s id="79">It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.</s>
 <s id="80">Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them.</s>
 <s id="81">Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.</s>
 <s id="82">We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.</s>
 <s id="83">The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us.</s>
 <s id="84">The more different somebody is, the less we trust them.</s>
 <s id="85">Now, that's a natural social bias.</s>
 <s id="86">But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews.</s>
 <s id="87">Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes.</s>
 <s id="88">But if you've got more than 10, everything changes.</s>
 <s id="89">High reputation beats high similarity.</s>
 <s id="90">The right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases.</s>
 <s id="91">Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust takes the right amount of disclosure.</s>
 <s id="92">This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.</s>
 <s id="93">If you share too little, like, "Yo," acceptance rates go down.</s>
 <s id="94">And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother," (Laughter) acceptance rates also go down.</s>
 <p id="p95">
  <s id="95.1">But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place.</s>
  <s id="95.2">Coming for vacation with my family."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="96">So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?</s>
 <s id="97">We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.</s>
 <s id="98">We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.</s>
 <s id="99">What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.</s>
 <s id="100">This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.</s>
 <s id="101">There's three things happening here.</s>
 <s id="102">The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.</s>
 <s id="103">The second is the efforts of our team.</s>
 <s id="104">And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.</s>
 <s id="105">Now, things have been going pretty well.</s>
 <s id="106">Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.</s>
 <s id="107">Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes.</s>
 <s id="108">Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.</s>
 <s id="109">In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone.</s>
 <s id="110">I was at the front lines of trust breaking.</s>
 <s id="111">And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them.</s>
 <s id="112">And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving.</s>
 <s id="113">Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.</s>
 <s id="114">Turns out, people are justified in their trust.</s>
 <s id="115">And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical.</s>
 <s id="116">We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack.</s>
 <s id="117">The host rushed him to the hospital.</s>
 <s id="118">They donated their own blood for his operation.</s>
 <s id="119">Let me read you his review.</s>
 <s id="120">(Laughter) "Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions.</s>
 <s id="121">(Laughter) The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.</s>
 <s id="122">(Laughter) Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you.</s>
 <s id="123">They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.</s>
 <s id="124">They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.</s>
 <s id="125">And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.</s>
 <s id="126">Highly recommended!"</s>
 <s id="127">(Applause) Of course, not every stay is like that.</s>
 <s id="128">But this connection beyond the transaction is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.</s>
 <s id="129">Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up.</s>
 <s id="130">How do sharing and transactions go together?</s>
 <s id="131">So let's be clear; it is about commerce.</s>
 <s id="132">But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete.</s>
 <s id="133">The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.</s>
 <s id="134">People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</s>
 <s id="135">You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic.</s>
 <s id="136">What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences?</s>
 <s id="137">What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.</s>
 <s id="138">Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?</s>
 <s id="139">Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.</s>
 <s id="140">What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?</s>
 <s id="141">What would that look like?</s>
 <s id="142">What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?</s>
 <s id="143">I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation.</s>
 <s id="144">In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this.</s>
 <s id="145">They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots to be shared by residents.</s>
 <s id="146">They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.</s>
 <s id="147">And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups.</s>
 <s id="148">Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs.</s>
 <s id="149">Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.</s>
 <s id="150">We didn't invent anything new.</s>
 <s id="151">Hospitality has been around forever.</s>
 <s id="152">There's been many other websites like ours.</s>
 <s id="153">So, why did ours eventually take off?</s>
 <s id="154">Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that.</s>
 <s id="155">Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias.</s>
 <s id="156">And that's amazing to me.</s>
 <s id="157">It blows my mind.</s>
 <s id="158">I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.</s>
 <s id="159">Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.</s>
 <s id="160">But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?</s>
 <s id="161">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="162">(Applause)</s>
