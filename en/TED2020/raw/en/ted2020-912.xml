 <s id="1">I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people, and that was in 1960.</s>
 <s id="2">I'm going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future, but I will not use digital technology, as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.</s>
 <s id="3">Instead, I have progressed, and I am, today, launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKEA: this box.</s>
 <s id="4">This box contains one billion people.</s>
 <s id="5">And our teacher told us that the industrialized world, 1960, had one billion people.</s>
 <s id="6">In the developing world, she said, they had two billion people.</s>
 <s id="7">And they lived away then.</s>
 <s id="8">There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world.</s>
 <s id="9">In the industrialized world, people were healthy, educated, rich, and they had small families.</s>
 <s id="10">And their aspiration was to buy a car.</s>
 <s id="11">And in 1960, all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this.</s>
 <s id="12">This was the economic level at which Sweden was.</s>
 <s id="13">But in contrast to this, in the developing world, far away, the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day.</s>
 <s id="14">They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.</s>
 <s id="15">There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.</s>
 <s id="16">And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."</s>
 <s id="17">But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.</s>
 <s id="18">And that's what I'm going to show you, because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population.</s>
 <s id="19">Just look how many.</s>
 <s id="20">The world population has doubled since I went to school.</s>
 <s id="21">And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.</s>
 <s id="22">A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy, so the Western population moved over to here.</s>
 <s id="23">And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.</s>
 <s id="24">Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly.</s>
 <s id="25">So this is where they are today.</s>
 <s id="26">And the most successful of the developing countries, they have moved on, you know, and they have become emerging economies, we call them.</s>
 <s id="27">They are now buying cars.</s>
 <s id="28">And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company, Geely, they acquired the Volvo company, and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world.</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) So there they are.</s>
 <s id="30">And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes, they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago.</s>
 <s id="31">The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here, which are also becoming emerging economies, because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated, and they already also have two to three children per woman, as those [richer also] have.</s>
 <s id="32">And their aspiration now is, of course, to buy a bicycle, and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.</s>
 <s id="33">But this is the world we have today, no longer any gap.</s>
 <s id="34">But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest, to the very richest over here is wider than ever.</s>
 <s id="35">But there is a continuous world from walking, biking, driving, flying -- there are people on all levels, and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.</s>
 <s id="36">This is the new world we have today in 2010.</s>
 <s id="37">And what will happen in the future?</s>
 <s id="38">Well, I'm going to project into 2050.</s>
 <s id="39">I was in Shanghai recently, and I listened to what's happening in China, and it's pretty sure that they will catch up, just as Japan did.</s>
 <s id="40">All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with one to two or three percent.</s>
 <s id="41">[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.</s>
 <s id="42">They will start flying.</s>
 <s id="43">And these lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries, they will also forge forwards economically.</s>
 <s id="44">And if, but only if, we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change, and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here.</s>
 <s id="45">And they will start to buy electric cars.</s>
 <s id="46">This is what we will find there.</s>
 <s id="47">So what about the poorest two billion?</s>
 <s id="48">What about the poorest two billion here?</s>
 <s id="49">Will they move on?</s>
 <s id="50">Well, here population [growth] comes in because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman, family planning is widely used, and population growth is coming to an end.</s>
 <s id="51">Here [among the poorest], population is growing.</s>
 <s id="52">So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades, increase to three billion, and they will thereafter increase to four billion.</s>
 <s id="53">There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen -- that can stop this [growth] from happening.</s>
 <s id="54">Because we already have this [growth] in process.</s>
 <s id="55">But if, and only if, [the poorest] get out of poverty, they get education, they get improved child survival, they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here, then population growth will stop in 2050.</s>
 <s id="56">We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth.</s>
 <s id="57">And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology.</s>
 <s id="58">Here I have on the screen my country bubbles.</s>
 <p id="p59">
  <s id="59.1">Every bubble is a country.</s>
  <s id="59.2">The size is population.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="60">The colors show the continent.</s>
 <s id="61">The yellow on there is the Americas; dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia.</s>
 <p id="p62">
  <s id="62.1">That's India and this is China.</s>
  <s id="62.2">Size is population.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="63">Here I have children per woman: two children, four children, six children, eight children -- big families, small families.</s>
 <s id="64">The year is 1960.</s>
 <s id="65">And down here, child survival, the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school: 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90, and almost 100 percent, as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.</s>
 <s id="66">But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960: one billion Western world here -- high child-survival, small families -- and all the rest, the rainbow of developing countries, with very large families and poor child survival.</s>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">What has happened?</s>
  <s id="67.2">I start the world.</s>
  <s id="67.3">Here we go.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?</s>
 <p id="p69">
  <s id="69.1">They get soap, hygiene, education, vaccination, penicillin and then family planning.</s>
  <s id="69.2">Family size is decreasing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="70">[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease, and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there [to small families].</s>
 <s id="71">Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.</s>
 <s id="72">The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size, but we still have the poorest billion.</s>
 <s id="73">Can you see the poorest billion, those [two] boxes I had over here?</s>
 <s id="74">They are still up here.</s>
 <s id="75">And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent, meaning that if you have six children born, there will be at least four who survive to the next generation.</s>
 <s id="76">And the population will double in one generation.</s>
 <s id="77">So the only way of really getting world population [growth] to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent.</s>
 <s id="78">That's why investments by Gates Foundation, UNICEF and aid organizations, together with national government in the poorest countries, are so good; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world.</s>
 <s id="79">We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.</s>
 <s id="80">Child survival is the new green.</s>
 <s id="81">It's only by child survival that we will stop population growth.</s>
 <s id="82">And will it happen?</s>
 <s id="83">Well, I'm not an optimist, neither am I a pessimist.</s>
 <s id="84">I'm a very serious "possibilist."</s>
 <s id="85">It's a new category where we take emotion apart, and we just work analytically with the world.</s>
 <s id="86">It can be done.</s>
 <s id="87">We can have a much more just world.</s>
 <s id="88">With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty, and global governance, the world can become like this.</s>
 <s id="89">And look at the position of the old West.</s>
 <s id="90">Remember when this blue box was all alone, leading the world, living its own life.</s>
 <s id="91">This will not happen [again].</s>
 <s id="92">The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less.</s>
 <s id="93">But it's a very important role.</s>
 <s id="94">Do it well and get used to it.</s>
 <s id="95">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="96">(Applause)</s>
