 <s id="1">About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel.</s>
 <s id="2">This happens after millions of years of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium, carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron.</s>
 <s id="3">No longer able to produce sufficient energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational pressure and explodes in a supernova.</s>
 <s id="4">The star shoots most of its innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements.</s>
 <s id="5">But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits into the depths of atomic nuclei.</s>
 <s id="6">The death of that star is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics of supercondensed matter.</s>
 <s id="7">But what is a neutron star?</s>
 <s id="8">Think of a compact ball inside of which protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust.</s>
 <s id="9">This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest in a space of a sugar cube.</s>
 <s id="10">Deeper in the crust, the neutron superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna to spaghetti-like shapes.</s>
 <s id="11">The massive precursors to neutron stars often spin.</s>
 <s id="12">When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are only about 25 kilometers across.</s>
 <s id="13">But the original star’s angular momentum is preserved.</s>
 <s id="14">So for the same reason that a figure skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more rapidly than its parent.</s>
 <s id="15">The fastest neutron star on record rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface whirls through space at more than a fifth of the speed of light.</s>
 <s id="16">Neutron stars also have the strongest magnetic field of any known object.</s>
 <s id="17">This magnetic concentration forms vortexes that radiate beams from the magnetic poles.</s>
 <s id="18">Since the poles aren’t always aligned with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink when viewed from Earth.</s>
 <s id="19">We call those pulsars.</s>
 <s id="20">The detection of one of these tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly discovered neutron stars in the first place.</s>
 <s id="21">An aging neutron star’s furious rotation slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form of electromagnetic and gravity waves.</s>
 <s id="22">But not all neutron stars disappear so quietly.</s>
 <s id="23">For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star co-orbits another star.</s>
 <s id="24">A neutron star can feed on a lighter companion, gorging on its more loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing cataclysmically into a black hole.</s>
 <s id="25">While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other in a waltz doomed to end as a merger.</s>
 <s id="26">When they finally collide, they send gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone thrown into a calm lake.</s>
 <s id="27">Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision.</s>
 <s id="28">Other telescopes picked up a burst of gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, all from the same impact.</s>
 <s id="29">That became the most studied event in the history of astronomy.</s>
 <s id="30">It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed of gravity, bolster important theories in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin of heavy elements like gold and platinum.</s>
 <s id="31">Neutron stars haven’t given up all their secrets yet.</s>
 <s id="32">LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded to detect more collisions.</s>
 <s id="33">That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, pulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.</s>
