 <s id="1">When I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative U.S. state I live in, Kansas.</s>
 <s id="2">I didn't follow along with the crowd.</s>
 <s id="3">I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.</s>
 <s id="4">I was outspoken and extremely social.</s>
 <s id="5">Even these pictures and postcards of my London semester abroad 16 years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.</s>
 <s id="6">(Laughter) But that same year I was in London, 16 years ago, I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique, and that changed everything.</s>
 <s id="7">I became the opposite of who I thought I once was.</s>
 <s id="8">I stayed in my room instead of socializing.</s>
 <s id="9">I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.</s>
 <s id="10">I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.</s>
 <s id="11">I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing, not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.</s>
 <s id="12">I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.</s>
 <s id="13">After all, I was a bit unconventional.</s>
 <s id="14">But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding.</s>
 <s id="15">Hiding is a progressive habit, and once you start hiding, it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.</s>
 <s id="16">In fact, even now, when I was talking to people about what this talk was about, I made up a cover story and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk.</s>
 <s id="17">So it is fitting and scary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding.</s>
 <s id="18">What have I been hiding for 16 years?</s>
 <s id="19">I am a lesbian.</s>
 <s id="20">(Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="21">I've struggled to say those words, because I didn't want to be defined by them.</s>
 <s id="22">Every time I would think about coming out in the past, I would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana, uniquely Morgana, but not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana."</s>
 <s id="23">Just Morgana.</s>
 <s id="24">For those of you from large metropolitan areas, this may not seem like a big deal to you.</s>
 <s id="25">It may seem strange that I have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long.</s>
 <s id="26">But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.</s>
 <s id="27">And I'm not alone, of course.</s>
 <s id="28">A 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity.</s>
 <s id="29">Of all the employees they surveyed, 61 percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work.</s>
 <s id="30">Of all the gay, lesbian and bisexual employees, 83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work "too gay."</s>
 <s id="31">The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs, employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their long-term career advancement.</s>
 <s id="32">And while I was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves, I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions.</s>
 <s id="33">Twelve years: the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities compared to accepting communities.</s>
 <s id="34">Twelve years reduced life expectancy.</s>
 <s id="35">When I read that in The Advocate magazine this year, I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.</s>
 <s id="36">The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.</s>
 <s id="37">The study found that gays in anti-gay communities had higher rates of heart disease, violence and suicide.</s>
 <s id="38">What I once thought was simply a personal matter I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine.</s>
 <s id="39">My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination.</s>
 <s id="40">I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay, but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas.</s>
 <s id="41">In February, the Kansas House of Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.</s>
 <s id="42">A former coworker and friend of mine has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.</s>
 <s id="43">He voted in favor of the bill, in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me.</s>
 <s id="44">How does my friend feel about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people?</s>
 <s id="45">How does her father feel?</s>
 <s id="46">I don't know, because I was never honest with them about who I am.</s>
 <s id="47">And that shakes me to the core.</s>
 <s id="48">What if I had told her my story years ago?</s>
 <s id="49">Could she have told her father my experience?</s>
 <s id="50">Could I have ultimately helped change his vote?</s>
 <s id="51">I will never know, and that made me realize I had done nothing to try to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="52">How ironic that I work in human resources, a profession that works to welcome, connect and encourage the development of employees, a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace, and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.</s>
 <s id="53">When I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti-discrimination policies that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.</s>
 <s id="54">Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.</s>
 <s id="55">When I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.</s>
 <s id="56">But I didn't.</s>
 <s id="57">Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, I did nothing.</s>
 <s id="58">(Applause) When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad 16 years ago, I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."</s>
 <s id="59">"There are more scary things inside than outside."</s>
 <s id="60">And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom: "Remember this."</s>
 <s id="61">I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London, but the message I missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself.</s>
 <s id="62">What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities.</s>
 <s id="63">I believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.</s>
 <s id="64">I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long.</s>
 <s id="65">I hope that this means I will never hide again, and I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives.</s>
 <s id="66">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="67">(Applause)</s>
