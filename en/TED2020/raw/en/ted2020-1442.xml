 <s id="1">I'm a very lucky person.</s>
 <s id="2">I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth and the people and creatures that live on it.</s>
 <s id="3">And my passion was inspired at the age of seven, when my parents first took me to Morocco, at the edge of the Sahara Desert.</s>
 <s id="4">Now imagine a little Brit somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.</s>
 <s id="5">What an amazing experience.</s>
 <s id="6">And it made me want to explore more.</s>
 <s id="7">So as a filmmaker, I've been from one end of the Earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before.</s>
 <s id="8">And what's more, I'm really lucky, because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.</s>
 <s id="9">Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.</s>
 <s id="10">You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects, but new technology is changing the way we can film.</s>
 <s id="11">It's enabling us to get fresh, new images and tell brand new stories.</s>
 <s id="12">In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that.</s>
 <s id="13">Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.</s>
 <s id="14">You see them all the time, you think.</s>
 <s id="15">But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed.</s>
 <s id="16">So what we did, we went to Alaska, which is where the grizzlies rely on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes for their denning.</s>
 <s id="17">And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.</s>
 <s id="18">(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.</s>
 <s id="19">There is nothing to eat up here, but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.</s>
 <s id="20">Lots of snow in which to dig a den.</s>
 <s id="21">To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast, where the snow will already be melting.</s>
 <s id="22">But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.</s>
 <s id="23">These mountains are dangerous places, but ultimately the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon.</s>
 <s id="24">KB: I love that shot.</s>
 <s id="25">I always get goosebumps every time I see it.</s>
 <s id="26">That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilized camera.</s>
 <s id="27">And it's a wonderful bit of gear, because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.</s>
 <s id="28">But technology alone isn't enough.</s>
 <s id="29">To really get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time.</s>
 <s id="30">And that sequence was especially difficult.</s>
 <s id="31">The first year we got nothing.</s>
 <s id="32">We had to go back the following year, all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.</s>
 <s id="33">And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.</s>
 <s id="34">And eventually we got lucky.</s>
 <s id="35">The cloud lifted, the wind was still, and even the bear showed up.</s>
 <s id="36">And we managed to get that magic moment.</s>
 <s id="37">For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered.</s>
 <s id="38">Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.</s>
 <s id="39">In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.</s>
 <s id="40">And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower.</s>
 <s id="41">It depends solely on the bat.</s>
 <s id="42">Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this.</s>
 <s id="43">See what you think.</s>
 <s id="44">(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.</s>
 <s id="45">A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.</s>
 <s id="46">But how to reach it?</s>
 <s id="47">Necessity is the mother of evolution.</s>
 <s id="48">(Music) This two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue, the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world.</s>
 <s id="49">If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.</s>
 <s id="50">(Applause) KB: What a tongue.</s>
 <s id="51">We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.</s>
 <s id="52">So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.</s>
 <s id="53">Now people often ask me, "Where's your favorite place on the planet?"</s>
 <s id="54">And the truth is I just don't have one.</s>
 <s id="55">There are so many wonderful places.</s>
 <s id="56">But some locations draw you back time and time again.</s>
 <s id="57">And one remote location -- I first went there as a backpacker; I've been back several times for filming, most recently for Untamed Americas -- it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America, and it's the most otherworldly place I know.</s>
 <s id="58">But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.</s>
 <s id="59">It's freezing cold, and that thin air really gets you.</s>
 <s id="60">Sometimes it's hard to breathe, especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.</s>
 <s id="61">And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.</s>
 <s id="62">But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity.</s>
 <s id="63">Have a look.</s>
 <s id="64">(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics, between Chile and Bolivia, the Andes completely change.</s>
 <s id="65">It's called the Altiplano, or "high plains" -- a place of extremes and extreme contrasts.</s>
 <s id="66">Where deserts freeze and waters boil.</s>
 <s id="67">More like Mars than Earth, it seems just as hostile to life.</s>
 <s id="68">The stars themselves -- at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing.</s>
 <s id="69">Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.</s>
 <s id="70">But just looking up with the naked eye, you really don't need one.</s>
 <s id="71">(Music) (Applause) KB: Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.</s>
 <s id="72">Thank you for letting me share that with you.</s>
 <s id="73">(Applause)</s>
