 <s id="1">Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil, slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient observer of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience.</s>
 <s id="2">Historically, the union between Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one.</s>
 <s id="3">They maintained the equilibrium between thought and action on which the well-being of the world depended.</s>
 <s id="4">Without Parvati as the agent of energy, growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, and the world would remain static.</s>
 <s id="5">But together, the two formed a divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection to all living things.</s>
 <s id="6">For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped far and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart to Shiva’s powers of raw creation.</s>
 <s id="7">She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants were bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually.</s>
 <s id="8">Yet a rift had grown between these two formidable forces.</s>
 <s id="9">While Parvati sustained daily life with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling about their roles in the universe.</s>
 <s id="10">He believed that Brahma, the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane purely for his own fancy.</s>
 <s id="11">And therefore, all material things were merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion.</s>
 <s id="12">For millennia Parvati had merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed the things she nurtured.</s>
 <s id="13">But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove the importance of her work once and for all.</s>
 <s id="14">She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy that kept the Earth turning.</s>
 <s id="15">At her disappearance, a sudden, terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence.</s>
 <s id="16">Without Parvati, the land became dry and barren.</s>
 <s id="17">Rivers shrank and crops shriveled in the fields.</s>
 <s id="18">Hunger descended on humanity.</s>
 <s id="19">Parents struggled to console their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled.</s>
 <s id="20">With nothing to eat, people no longer gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank from the darkening world.</s>
 <s id="21">To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness left by his wife’s absence.</s>
 <s id="22">Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt bottomless and unbearable.</s>
 <s id="23">As Shiva despaired over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that the material world could not be so easily dismissed.</s>
 <s id="24">At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away.</s>
 <s id="25">To walk among them and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle.</s>
 <s id="26">As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, the Goddess of food.</s>
 <s id="27">With the arrival of Annapurna, the world blossomed anew.</s>
 <s id="28">People rejoiced at fertility and food, and communed together to give thanks.</s>
 <s id="29">Some believe that Annapurna first appeared in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, on the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen to fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more.</s>
 <s id="30">But it was not only mere mortals who were served at her feast.</s>
 <s id="31">Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure blooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness.</s>
 <s id="32">For this reason, the supreme deity is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand, while the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance.</s>
 <s id="33">With these symbols, this powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world is anything but an illusion.</s>
 <s id="34">Rather, it is a cycle of life that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths and rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth.</s>
