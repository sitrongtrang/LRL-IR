 <s id="2">And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless.</s>
 <s id="3">So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line.</s>

 <s id="6">And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) Thank you.</s>
 <s id="8">(Applause) (Applause) For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, "Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason.</s>

  <s id="11.2">I get asked in interviews a lot, "My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"</s>

 <s id="12">(Laughter) "You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="14">(Applause)</s>
