 <s id="1">I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.</s>
 <s id="2">And that was largely because there weren't any.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.</s>
 <s id="4">A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.</s>
 <s id="5">And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.</s>
 <s id="6">During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.</s>
 <s id="7">So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.</s>
 <s id="8">And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.</s>
 <s id="9">And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.</s>
 <s id="10">I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.</s>
 <s id="11">(Applause) It's about Billie Holiday.</s>
 <s id="12">And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.</s>
 <s id="13">But I know where she was.</s>
 <s id="14">She was with me on my lifeboat.</s>
 <s id="15">And she was hot.</s>
 <s id="16">(Music) ♫ Billie crept softly ♫ ♫ into my waking arms ♫ ♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫ ♫ Strange fruit for ♫ ♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫ ♫ Panic at the stage door ♫ ♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫ ♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫ ♫ Must have left the building ♫ ♫ body and soul ♫ ♫ On a creaky ♫ ♫ piano stool tonight ♫ ♫ as the moon is my ♫ ♫ only witness ♫ ♫ She was breathing ♫ ♫ in my ear ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫ ♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫ ♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫ ♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫ ♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫ ♫ See in the new age ♫ ♫ alone ♫ ♫ Stay with me ♫ ♫ again tonight ♫ ♫ Billie, time, ♫ ♫ time is a wily trickster ♫ ♫ Still an echo ♫ ♫ in my heart says, ♫ ♫ "This time it's love" ♫ (Applause)</s>
