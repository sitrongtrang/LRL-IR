 <s id="1">I opened a blind man's head.</s>
 <s id="2">I didn't make him think or reflect -- I cracked his head open, literally.</s>
 <s id="3">We were walking with him holding onto my shoulder, I miscalculated how much space there was between us, and I knocked him into a gate.</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) Five stitches in his forehead.</s>
 <s id="5">At that moment, I felt like the worst teacher in the world.</s>
 <s id="6">I really didn't know how to apologize.</s>
 <s id="7">Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people who takes things quite well.</s>
 <s id="8">And to this day, he says that I was the coach who left the most important mark on his career.</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) The truth is, when I started working at the institute for the blind, I was surprised by a lot of things.</s>
 <s id="10">A lot of the things they did, I never imagined they could: they swam, did exercise, played cards.</s>
 <s id="11">They drank mate, and could pour it without burning themselves in the process.</s>
 <s id="12">But when I saw them playing soccer -- that was amazing.</s>
 <s id="13">They had a dirt field, rusty goalposts and broken nets.</s>
 <s id="14">The blind who attended the institute would play their games there, just like I did at a field near my house.</s>
 <s id="15">But they played without being able to see.</s>
 <s id="16">The ball made a sound so they could locate it.</s>
 <s id="17">They had a guide behind the rival team's goal to know where to kick the ball.</s>
 <s id="18">And they used eye masks.</s>
 <s id="19">There were guys who could still see a little, and they wore eye masks so everyone was equal.</s>
 <s id="20">When I was more at ease with them, I asked for a mask myself.</s>
 <s id="21">I put it on and tried to play.</s>
 <s id="22">I had played soccer all my life.</s>
 <s id="23">This is where it got even more amazing: within two seconds, I didn't know where I was standing.</s>
 <s id="24">I had studied physical education because I loved high performance.</s>
 <s id="25">I started working at the institute by chance.</s>
 <s id="26">My other job was with the Argentinian National Rowing Team, and I felt that was my thing.</s>
 <s id="27">Here, everything was twice as hard.</s>
 <s id="28">I'll never forget the first day I did the warm-up with the team.</s>
 <s id="29">I lined them up in front of me -- I used to do that with the rowing team -- and I said, "OK, everyone bend down," going like this.</s>
 <s id="30">When I looked up, two guys were seated, three were lying down and others were squatting.</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) How could I do here the same things I was doing there?</s>
 <s id="32">It took me a while.</s>
 <s id="33">I started looking for tools to learn from them, from the teachers who worked with them.</s>
 <s id="34">I learned I couldn't explain a play on a chalkboard like a coach does, but I could use a plastic tray and some bottle caps so they could follow me by way of touch.</s>
 <s id="35">I also learned they could run on a track if I ran with them, holding a rope.</s>
 <s id="36">So we started looking for volunteers to help us run with them.</s>
 <s id="37">I was enjoying it, and finding purpose and meaning in what we were doing.</s>
 <s id="38">It was hard at first, it was uncomfortable, but I decided to overcome the discomfort.</s>
 <s id="39">And there came a time when it became the most fascinating job I'd ever had.</s>
 <s id="40">I think that's when I wondered: Why couldn't we be a high-performance team as well?</s>
 <s id="41">Of course, one thing was missing: I needed to find out what they wanted, the real protagonists of this story.</s>
 <s id="42">Three hours of training, playing soccer on that field, were not going to be enough.</s>
 <s id="43">We would have to train differently.</s>
 <s id="44">We started to train harder, and the results were great; they asked for more.</s>
 <s id="45">I came to understand that they, too, wondered why they couldn't do high-performance.</s>
 <s id="46">When we felt ready, we knocked at CENARD's door.</s>
 <s id="47">CENARD is the National Center for High-Performance Sports here in Argentina.</s>
 <s id="48">It was hard to get them to hear what we had to say.</s>
 <s id="49">But it was considerably more difficult to get the other athletes training there to consider us their equals.</s>
 <s id="50">In fact, they would let us use the field only when no other teams were using it.</s>
 <s id="51">And we were known as "the blind ones."</s>
 <s id="52">Not everyone knew exactly what we were doing there.</s>
 <s id="53">The 2006 World Championship was a turning point in the team's history.</s>
 <s id="54">It was held in Buenos Aires for the first time.</s>
 <s id="55">It was our chance to show everyone what we had been doing all that time.</s>
 <s id="56">We made it to the finals.</s>
 <s id="57">We were growing as a team.</s>
 <s id="58">It was us against Brazil in the finals.</s>
 <s id="59">They were the best team in the tournament.</s>
 <s id="60">They won every game by a landslide.</s>
 <s id="61">Hardly anyone believed we could win that game.</s>
 <s id="62">Hardly anyone -- except for us.</s>
 <s id="63">During pre-game meetings, in the locker room, during each warm-up, it smelled of victory.</s>
 <s id="64">I swear that smell exists.</s>
 <s id="65">I smelled it several times with the team, but I remember it in particular, the day before we played that final.</s>
 <s id="66">The Argentine Football Association had opened their doors to us.</s>
 <s id="67">We were training at AFA, where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.</s>
 <s id="68">For the first time ever, we felt like a true national team.</s>
 <s id="69">At 7:30pm, the day before the game, we were in the lounge discussing strategy, and a waiter knocks on the door, interrupting our conversation.</s>
 <s id="70">He suggested we go to church.</s>
 <s id="71">He came to invite us to church.</s>
 <s id="72">I tried to get rid of him, saying it wasn't a good time, that we better leave it for another day.</s>
 <s id="73">He kept insisting, asking me to please let him take the guys to church, because that day, a pastor who performed miracles would be there.</s>
 <s id="74">I was slightly afraid to ask what type of miracles he meant, and he replied nonchalantly, "Coach, let me take the team to the church, and when we return, I guarantee that half of them will be able to see."</s>
 <s id="75">(Laughter) Some of the guys laughed, but imagine being a blind person and someone says that to you.</s>
 <s id="76">I didn't know what to say.</s>
 <s id="77">I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.</s>
 <s id="78">I didn't want to make him feel bad, because he truly believed this could happen.</s>
 <s id="79">One of the players saved me, when he stood up and confidently said, "Juan," -- that was the kid's name -- Gonza already told you it's not the best time to go to church.</s>
 <s id="80">Besides, let me make this clear: if we go to that church, and I end up being able to see when we return, I will beat you so hard if I can't play tomorrow."</s>
 <s id="81">(Laughter) (Applause) Juan left, laughing in resignation, and we continued with our pregame talk.</s>
 <s id="82">That night when I went to sleep, I began to dream about the next day's game, imagining what could happen, how we would play.</s>
 <s id="83">And that's when I noticed that smell of victory I mentioned a while ago.</s>
 <s id="84">And it's because at that moment, I thought: if the other players had the same desire as Diego going into the game, it was impossible for us not to win.</s>
 <s id="85">The next day was going to be wonderful.</s>
 <s id="86">We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm, and we were already eager to play.</s>
 <s id="87">We left AFA, and the bus was full of flags that people had given to us.</s>
 <p id="p88">
  <s id="88.1">We were talking about the game, and we could hear people honking and cheering, "Go Murciélagos!</s>
  <s id="88.2">Today's the day!</s>
  <s id="88.3">The final challenge!"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p89">
  <s id="89.1">The guys asked me, "Do they know us?</s>
  <s id="89.2">Do they know we're playing?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="90">Some people followed the bus to CENARD.</s>
 <s id="91">We arrived and found an amazing scene.</s>
 <s id="92">In the corridor leading from the locker room to the game field, I was walking with Silvio, who was holding onto my shoulder, so I could guide him.</s>
 <s id="93">Fortunately, there were no gates along the way.</s>
 <s id="94">(Laughter) When we reached the field, he asked me about everything.</s>
 <s id="95">He didn't want to miss a single detail.</s>
 <s id="96">He said, "Tell me what you see, tell me who's playing the drums."</s>
 <s id="97">I tried to explain what was happening with as much detail as possible.</s>
 <s id="98">I told him, "The stands are packed, a lot of people couldn't get in, there are blue and white balloons all over the field, they're opening a giant Argentine flag that covers the entire grandstand."</s>
 <s id="99">Suddenly, he cuts me off and says, "Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"</s>
 <s id="100">That's the city where he lives.</s>
 <s id="101">I started looking into the stands and I spotted a little white flag with lettering done in black spray paint, that read: "Silvio, your family and all of San Pedro are here."</s>
 <s id="102">I told him that and he replied, "That's my mom, tell me where she is, I want to I wave at her."</s>
 <s id="103">I pointed him toward the flag and showed him with his arm where they were sitting, and he waved his arms in that direction.</s>
 <s id="104">About 20 or 30 people stood up and gave him an ovation.</s>
 <s id="105">When that happened, I saw how his face changed, how moved he was.</s>
 <s id="106">It was moving for me, too; two seconds later, I had a lump in my throat.</s>
 <s id="107">It was strange -- I felt both the excitement of what was happening, and the anger and the anguish that he could not see it.</s>
 <s id="108">A few days later when I told him what I had experienced, he tried to reassure me, saying, "Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.</s>
 <s id="109">Differently, but I swear to you that I saw them all."</s>
 <s id="110">The game started.</s>
 <s id="111">We could not fail; it was the final.</s>
 <s id="112">The audience was quiet, like here, because in soccer for the blind, the public has to be quiet so the players can hear the ball.</s>
 <s id="113">They're only allowed to cheer when the game is over.</s>
 <s id="114">And when there were eight minutes to go, the crowd did all the cheering they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.</s>
 <s id="115">When pigeon-toed Silvio nailed the ball at an angle, they cheered with all their heart, in an incredible way.</s>
 <s id="116">Today, if you go to CENARD, you'll see a huge poster on the door, with a photo of our team, Los Murciélagos.</s>
 <s id="117">They're a model national team, everyone in CENARD knows who they are, and after having won two World Championships and two Paralympic medals, no one doubts they are high-performance athletes.</s>
 <s id="118">(Applause) (Applause ends) I was lucky to train this team for 10 years, first as a trainer and later as their coach.</s>
 <s id="119">I feel that they've given me much more than what I've given them.</s>
 <s id="120">Last year, they asked me to coach another national team, Power Soccer.</s>
 <s id="121">It's a national team of young men who play soccer in wheelchairs.</s>
 <s id="122">They use motorized wheelchairs that they drive with a joystick, because they don't have enough strength in their arms to use conventional chairs.</s>
 <s id="123">They added a bumper to the chair, a safeguard that protects their feet, while allowing them to kick the ball.</s>
 <s id="124">It's the first time that, instead of being the spectators, they're now the main characters.</s>
 <s id="125">It's the first time their parents, friends and siblings can see them play.</s>
 <s id="126">For me, it's a new challenge, with the same discomfort, insecurity, and fear I had when I started working with the blind.</s>
 <s id="127">But I approach it all from a more experienced position.</s>
 <s id="128">That's why from day one, I treat them as athletes on the field, and off the field, I try to put myself in their shoes and behave without prejudice, because treating them naturally feels best to them.</s>
 <s id="129">Both teams play soccer; something once unthinkable for them.</s>
 <s id="130">They had to adapt the rules to do so.</s>
 <s id="131">And both teams broke the same rule -- the one that said they couldn't play soccer.</s>
 <s id="132">When you see them play, you see competition, not disability.</s>
 <s id="133">The problem starts when the game is over, and they leave the field.</s>
 <s id="134">Then they step in to play our game, in a society whose rules don't really take them into account or care for them.</s>
 <s id="135">I learned from sports that disability greatly depends on the rules of the game.</s>
 <s id="136">I believe that if we change some of the rules of our game, we can make life a little easier for them.</s>
 <s id="137">We all know there are people with disabilities; we see them daily.</s>
 <s id="138">But by having no direct contact with them, we're not aware of the problems they face every day, like how hard it is for them to get on a bus, find a job, take the subway or cross the street.</s>
 <s id="139">It's true that there is an increasing social responsibility regarding the inclusion of people with disabilities.</s>
 <s id="140">But I think it's still not enough.</s>
 <s id="141">I think change needs to come from every one of us.</s>
 <s id="142">First, by leaving behind our indifference toward the disabled, and then by respecting the rules that do take them into account.</s>
 <s id="143">They are few, but they do exist.</s>
 <s id="144">I cracked a blind man's head open -- El Pulga's head.</s>
 <s id="145">I can assure you these two teams opened mine as well.</s>
 <s id="146">They taught me that above all, you have to get out there and play every game in this beautiful tournament that we call life.</s>
 <s id="147">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="148">(Applause)</s>
