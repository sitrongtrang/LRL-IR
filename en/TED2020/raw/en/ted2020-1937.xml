 <s id="1">Almost two years ago, I was driving in my car in Germany, and I turned on the radio.</s>
 <s id="2">Europe at the time was in the middle of the Euro crisis, and all the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States.</s>
 <s id="3">I listened and thought to myself, "What are these rating agencies, and why is everybody so upset about their work?"</s>
 <s id="4">Well, if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years to trying to reform them, obviously I would have called you crazy.</s>
 <s id="5">But guess what's really crazy: the way these rating agencies are run.</s>
 <s id="6">And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this, but also how we can do it.</s>
 <s id="7">So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do.</s>
 <s id="8">As you would read a car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get, investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money.</s>
 <s id="9">A rating can range from a so-called AAA, which means it's a top-performing product, and it can go down to the level of the so-called BBB-, which means it's a fairly risky investment.</s>
 <s id="10">Rating agencies are rating companies.</s>
 <s id="11">They are rating banks.</s>
 <s id="12">They are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.</s>
 <s id="13">But they can also rate countries, and these ratings are called sovereign ratings, and I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings.</s>
 <s id="14">And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now, you're thinking, so why should I really care about this, right?</s>
 <s id="15">Be honest.</s>
 <s id="16">Well, ratings affect you.</s>
 <s id="17">They affect all of us.</s>
 <s id="18">If a rating agency rates a country, it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt.</s>
 <s id="19">So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency, the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets.</s>
 <s id="20">So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow.</s>
 <s id="21">But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive?</s>
 <s id="22">Well, then the country has less available for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.</s>
 <s id="23">And this is the reason why you should care, because sovereign ratings affect everyone.</s>
 <s id="24">And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods.</s>
 <s id="25">They should be transparent, accessible, and available to everyone at no cost.</s>
 <s id="26">But here's the situation: the rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only -- Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch -- and we know whenever there is a market concentration, there is really no competition.</s>
 <s id="27">There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product.</s>
 <s id="28">And let's face it, the credit rating agencies have contributed, putting the global economy on the brink, and yet they have to change the way they operate.</s>
 <s id="29">The second point, would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer?</s>
 <p id="p30">
  <s id="30.1">Obviously not, right?</s>
  <s id="30.2">That would be irresponsible.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="31">But that's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day.</s>
 <s id="32">The customers of these rating agencies, like countries or companies, they are paying for their own ratings, and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest.</s>
 <s id="33">The third point is, the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings, but in this day and age, you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside.</s>
 <s id="34">But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy, we really do not know what all the different ingredients are.</s>
 <s id="35">We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work, and we need to change this.</s>
 <s id="36">I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul, not just a trimming at the margins.</s>
 <s id="37">I think it's time for a bold move.</s>
 <s id="38">I think it's time to upgrade the system.</s>
 <s id="39">And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and effort thinking about an alternative for the sector.</s>
 <s id="40">And we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk, and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.</s>
 <s id="41">INCRA would make a difference to the current system by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.</s>
 <s id="42">It would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment.</s>
 <s id="43">The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation, to run the rating agency, and it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available.</s>
 <s id="44">But this is not enough to make a difference, right?</s>
 <s id="45">INCRA would also be based on a very, very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest, and it would include many stakeholders from society.</s>
 <s id="46">INCRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency, it would be a truly international one, in which, in particular, the emerging economies would have an equal interest, voice and representation.</s>
 <s id="47">The second big difference that INCRA would make is that would it base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators.</s>
 <s id="48">Think about it that way.</s>
 <s id="49">If we conduct a sovereign rating, we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country, its macroeconomic fundamentals.</s>
 <s id="50">But we also have to ask the question, who is cultivating the economic soil of a country, right?</s>
 <s id="51">Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government, so we have to ask the question, how is a country governed?</s>
 <s id="52">How is it managed?</s>
 <s id="53">And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators.</s>
 <s id="54">These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country.</s>
 <s id="55">I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education.</s>
 <s id="56">It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis, if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised.</s>
 <s id="57">For example, if INCRA would rate South Africa right now, of course we would take a very, very close look at the youth unemployment of the country, the highest in the world.</s>
 <s id="58">If over 70 percent of a country's population under the age of 35 is unemployed, of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future.</s>
 <s id="59">Well, our friends at Moody's, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well.</s>
 <p id="p60">
  <s id="60.1">But guess what?</s>
  <s id="60.2">We do not know exactly how they will take this into account.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="61">And this leads me to the third big difference that INCRA would make.</s>
 <s id="62">INCRA would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and methodology.</s>
 <s id="63">So in contrast to the current system, INCRA would be fully transparent.</s>
 <s id="64">So in a nutshell, INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition, it would increase the transparency of the sector, and it would also increase the quality.</s>
 <s id="65">I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world, but I tell you it's a very important one, and a very important one to fix, because sovereign ratings affect all of us, and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods.</s>
 <s id="66">And this is why we are testing our model right now, and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life.</s>
 <s id="67">I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest, and that we have the unique opportunity right now to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new, more inclusive financial system.</s>
 <s id="68">Because for way too long, we have left the big financial players on their own.</s>
 <s id="69">It's time to give them some company.</s>
 <s id="70">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="71">(Applause)</s>
