 <s id="1">It's a great honor to be here.</s>
 <s id="2">It's a great honor to be here talking about cities, talking about the future of cities.</s>
 <s id="3">It's great to be here as a mayor.</s>
 <s id="4">I really do believe that mayors have the political position to really change people's lives.</s>
 <s id="5">That's the place to be.</s>
 <s id="6">And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.</s>
 <s id="7">Rio's a beautiful city, a vibrant place, special place.</s>
 <s id="8">Actually, you're looking at a guy who has the best job in the world.</s>
 <s id="9">And I really wanted to share with you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio.</s>
 <s id="10">(Video) Announcer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the envelope containing the result.</s>
 <s id="11">Jacques Rogge: I have the honor to announce that the games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of Rio de Janeiro.</s>
 <s id="12">(Cheering) EP: Okay, that's very touching, very emotional, but it was not easy to get there.</s>
 <s id="13">Actually it was a very hard challenge.</s>
 <s id="14">We had to beat the European monarchy.</s>
 <s id="15">This is Juan Carlos, king of Spain.</s>
 <s id="16">We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all of their technology.</s>
 <s id="17">We had to beat the most powerful man in the world defending his own city.</s>
 <s id="18">So it was not easy at all.</s>
 <s id="19">And actually this last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that I think fits perfectly to the situation of Rio winning the Olympic bid.</s>
 <s id="20">We really showed that, yes, we can.</s>
 <s id="21">And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.</s>
 <s id="22">I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done, that you don't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way, that cities are a great challenge.</s>
 <s id="23">It's a difficult task to deal with cities.</s>
 <s id="24">But with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments, you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live.</s>
 <s id="25">I want you all to imagine Rio.</s>
 <s id="26">You probably think about a city full of energy, a vibrant city full of green.</s>
 <s id="27">And nobody showed that better than Carlos Saldanha in last year's "Rio."</s>
 <s id="28">(Music) (Video) Bird: This is incredible.</s>
 <s id="29">(Music) EP: Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that, but it's not like that everywhere.</s>
 <s id="30">We're like every big city in the world.</s>
 <s id="31">We've got lots of people, pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.</s>
 <s id="32">These pictures I'm showing here, they are some pictures from Madureira.</s>
 <s id="33">It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.</s>
 <s id="34">And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira, in this region, to see what we should think as our first commandment.</s>
 <s id="35">So every time you see a concrete jungle like that, what you've got to do is find open spaces.</s>
 <s id="36">If you don't have open spaces, you've got to go there and open spaces.</s>
 <s id="37">So go inside these open spaces and make it that people can get inside and use those spaces.</s>
 <s id="38">This is going to be the third largest park in Rio by June this year.</s>
 <s id="39">It's going to be a place where people can meet, where you can put nature.</s>
 <s id="40">The temperature's going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.</s>
 <s id="41">So the first commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to be environmentally friendly.</s>
 <s id="42">Every time you think of a city, you've got to think green.</s>
 <s id="43">You've got to think green and green.</s>
 <s id="44">So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.</s>
 <s id="45">Let's think that cities are made of people, lots of people together.</s>
 <s id="46">cities are packed with people.</s>
 <s id="47">So how do you move these people around?</s>
 <s id="48">When you have 3.5 billion people living in cities -- by 2050, it's going to be 6 billion people.</s>
 <s id="49">So every time you think about moving these people around, you think about high-capacity transportation.</s>
 <s id="50">But there is a problem.</s>
 <s id="51">High-capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money.</s>
 <s id="52">So what I'm going to show here is something that was already presented in TED by the former mayor of Curitiba who created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner.</s>
 <s id="53">And it's something that we're doing, again, lots in Rio.</s>
 <s id="54">It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.</s>
 <p id="p55">
  <s id="55.1">So you get a bus.</s>
  <s id="55.2">It's a simple bus that everybody knows.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="56">You transform it inside as a train car.</s>
 <s id="57">You use separate lanes, dedicated lanes.</s>
 <s id="58">The contractors, they don't like that.</s>
 <s id="59">You don't have to dig deep down underground.</s>
 <s id="60">You can build nice stations.</s>
 <s id="61">This is actually a station that we're doing in Rio.</s>
 <s id="62">Again, you don't have to dig deep down underground to make a station like that.</s>
 <s id="63">This station has the same comfort, the same features as a subway station.</s>
 <s id="64">A kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.</s>
 <s id="65">So spending much less money and doing it much faster, you can really change the way people move.</s>
 <s id="66">This is a map of Rio.</s>
 <s id="67">All the lines, the colored lines you see there, it's our high-capacity transportation network.</s>
 <s id="68">In this present time today, we only carry 18 percent of our population in high-capacity transportation.</s>
 <s id="69">With the BRTs we're doing, again, the cheapest and fastest way, we're going to move to 63 percent of the population being carried by high-capacity transportation.</s>
 <s id="70">So remember what I said: You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done.</s>
 <s id="71">You can find original ways to get things done.</s>
 <s id="72">So the second commandment I want to leave you tonight is, a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration of its people.</s>
 <s id="73">Moving to the third commandment.</s>
 <s id="74">And this is the most controversial one.</s>
 <s id="75">It has to do with the favelas, the slums -- whatever you call it, there are different names all over the world.</s>
 <s id="76">But the point we want to make here tonight is, favelas are not always a problem.</s>
 <s id="77">I mean, favelas can sometimes really be a solution, if you deal with them, if you put public policy inside the favelas.</s>
 <s id="78">Let me just show a map of Rio again.</s>
 <s id="79">Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants -- More than 20 percent, 1.4 million, live in the favelas.</s>
 <s id="80">All these red parts are favelas.</s>
 <s id="81">So you see, they are spread all over the city.</s>
 <s id="82">This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.</s>
 <s id="83">You see the contrast between the rich and poor.</s>
 <s id="84">So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.</s>
 <s id="85">The first one is, you can change from what I call a [vicious] circle to a virtual circle.</s>
 <s id="86">But what you've got to do to get that is you've got to go inside the favelas, bring in the basic services -- mainly education and health -- with high quality.</s>
 <s id="87">I'm going to give a fast example here.</s>
 <s id="88">This was an old building in a favela in Rio -- [unclear favela name] -- that we just transformed into a primary school, with high quality.</s>
 <s id="89">This is primary assistance in health that we built inside a favela, again, with high quality.</s>
 <s id="90">We call it a family clinic.</s>
 <s id="91">So the first point is bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality.</s>
 <s id="92">The second point I want to make about the favelas is, you've got to open spaces in the favela.</s>
 <s id="93">Bring infrastructure to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.</s>
 <s id="94">Rio has the aim, by 2020, to have all its favelas completely urbanized.</s>
 <s id="95">Another example, this was completely packed with houses, and then we built this, what we call, a knowledge square.</s>
 <s id="96">This is a place with high technology where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology.</s>
 <s id="97">We even built a theater there -- 3D movie.</s>
 <s id="98">And this is the kind of change you can get for that.</s>
 <s id="99">And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela.</s>
 <s id="100">So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is, a city of the future has to be socially integrated.</s>
 <s id="101">You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated.</s>
 <s id="102">But moving to our fourth commandment, I really wouldn't be here tonight.</s>
 <s id="103">Between November and May, Rio's completely packed.</s>
 <s id="104">We just had last week Carnivale.</s>
 <p id="p105">
  <s id="105.1">It was great.</s>
  <s id="105.2">It was lots of fun.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="106">We have New Year's Eve.</s>
 <s id="107">There's like two million people on Copacabana Beach.</s>
 <s id="108">We have problems.</s>
 <s id="109">We fight floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.</s>
 <s id="110">You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes.</s>
 <s id="111">We have problems with the tropical rains.</s>
 <s id="112">Almost every year we have these landslides, which are terrible.</s>
 <s id="113">But the reason I could come here is because of that.</s>
 <s id="114">This was something we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old.</s>
 <s id="115">It's what we call the Operations Center of Rio.</s>
 <s id="116">And I wanted to show that I can govern my city, using technology, from here, from Long Beach, so I got here last night and I know everything.</s>
 <s id="117">We're going to speak now to the Operations Center.</s>
 <s id="118">This is Osorio, he's our secretary of urban affairs.</s>
 <s id="119">So Osorio, good to be there with you.</s>
 <s id="120">I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of year.</s>
 <s id="121">So how's the weather in Rio now?</s>
 <p id="p122">
  <s id="122.1">Osorio: The weather is fine.</s>
  <s id="122.2">We have fair weather today.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="123">Let me get you our weather satellite radar.</s>
 <s id="124">You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.</s>
 <s id="125">Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather, today and in the next few days.</s>
 <s id="126">EP: Okay, how's the traffic?</s>
 <s id="127">We, at this time of year, get lots of traffic jams.</s>
 <p id="p128">
  <s id="128.1">People get mad at the mayor.</s>
  <s id="128.2">So how's the traffic tonight?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="129">Osario: Well traffic tonight is fine.</s>
 <s id="130">Let me get you one of our 8,000 buses.</s>
 <s id="131">A live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.</s>
 <s id="132">You see, the streets are clear.</s>
 <s id="133">Now it's 11:00 pm in Rio.</s>
 <s id="134">Nothing of concern in terms of traffic.</s>
 <s id="135">I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.</s>
 <s id="136">We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern.</s>
 <s id="137">We are below average in terms of traffic incidents in the city.</s>
 <s id="138">EP: Okay, so you're showing now some public services.</s>
 <s id="139">These are the cars.</s>
 <s id="140">Osorio: Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.</s>
 <s id="141">Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.</s>
 <s id="142">This is live transmission.</s>
 <s id="143">We have GPS's in all of our trucks.</s>
 <s id="144">And you can see them working in all parts of the city.</s>
 <s id="145">Waste collection on time.</s>
 <s id="146">Public services working well.</s>
 <s id="147">EP: Okay, Osorio, thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="148">It was great to have you here.</s>
 <s id="149">We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.</s>
 <s id="150">(Applause) Okay, so no files, this place, no paperwork, no distance, 24/7 working.</s>
 <s id="151">So the fourth commandment I want to share with you here tonight is, a city of the future has to use technology to be present.</s>
 <s id="152">I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.</s>
 <s id="153">But everything that I said here tonight, or the commandments, are means, are ways, for us to govern cities -- invest in infrastructure, invest in the green, open parks, open spaces, integrate socially, use technology.</s>
 <s id="154">But at the end of the day, when we talk about cities, we talk about a gathering of people.</s>
 <s id="155">And we cannot see that as a problem.</s>
 <s id="156">That is fantastic.</s>
 <s id="157">If there's 3.5 billion now, it's going to be six billion then it's going to be 10 billion.</s>
 <s id="158">That is great, that means we're going to have 10 billion minds working together, 10 billion talents together.</s>
 <s id="159">So a city of the future, I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens, integrates socially its citizens.</s>
 <s id="160">A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party, which are cities.</s>
 <s id="161">Thank you very much.</s>
 <s id="162">(Applause)</s>
