 <s id="1">Have you ever helped set a table and found yourself wondering where to place the forks?</s>
 <s id="2">Or sat down to eat a restaurant and wondered which utensils to use?</s>
 <s id="3">Well, here's some simple, traditional etiquette tips on how to set a table.</s>
 <s id="4">What would happen if you set a table like this?</s>
 <s id="5">It doesn't look good, and you have to clean up the mess before you can even start.</s>
 <s id="6">Let's try another way.</s>
 <s id="7">To start, use a placemat or tablecloth, but not both, so the dishes aren't directly on the table.</s>
 <s id="8">This is more about looks than etiquette, but it's rare to see nothing under a plate unless you're eating at a picnic table.</s>
 <s id="9">Set out any flowers, candlesticks, or other decorations you like.</s>
 <s id="10">Candles are usually only lit at night.</s>
 <s id="11">Start with utensils for the main course, putting your dinner fork on the left and your dinner knife on the right-hand side since these are the hands we use them with.</s>
 <s id="12">Here's a helpful tip: You always eat outside-in, so to set for salad, we'll put the salad fork to the outside of the dinner fork and the salad knife to the outside of the dinner knife.</s>
 <s id="13">We'll have salad first, then our main course.</s>
 <s id="14">Notice, too, that the knife blades are both pointed toward the plate.</s>
 <s id="15">This is an old tradition from a time when dinner knives were quite sharp, and it was a sign of politeness and nonaggression to keep them pointed away from other diners.</s>
 <s id="16">We might have some soup, and since soup usually comes first, the soup spoon goes outside the knives since we use our right hand to hold it.</s>
 <s id="17">Here's another tip: Only set the table with what you'll need.</s>
 <s id="18">If you're not eating soup, don't set a soup spoon.</s>
 <s id="19">Now, for dessert, we'll have ice cream so we'll place the dessert up top since we don't need it for a little while.</s>
 <s id="20">Notice that the bowl of the spool is pointing to the left.</s>
 <s id="21">This way, when it's time to eat, you just slide it down and it's in the right spot.</s>
 <s id="22">If you were having cake, you'd set a fork and flip it 180 degrees so it would be right side-up on the left instead.</s>
 <s id="23">Next we'll anchor our setting with the plate.</s>
 <s id="24">You can also serve from the kitchen then bring them to the table.</s>
 <s id="25">The bread plate goes up and to the left of the setting, and the butter knife goes on the plate at an angle, again, with the blade pointing in.</s>
 <s id="26">There's only one spot left, and that's for the drinks.</s>
 <s id="27">Set the wine glass to the upper right, and then place the water glass to the left of it at an angle.</s>
 <s id="28">If you're like me and can never remember which goes where, think water, wine, w-a, w-i; a, i; they go left to right in alphabetical order.</s>
 <s id="29">Another tip: To remember left and right with the bread and the drinks, think B-M-W like the car.</s>
 <s id="30">B, your bread plate, is on the left; M, your meal, is in the middle, and W, your water, is on the right.</s>
 <s id="31">Lastly, the napkin traditionally goes to the left of the forks, though it's okay to put it underneath them, too.</s>
 <s id="32">For a fancier meal like this one that takes up a lot of space, we'll put it in the middle.</s>
 <s id="33">Now we're ready to eat.</s>
 <s id="34">Hopefully these tips will be helpful the next time you're asked to help set the table or sit down at a fancy meal.</s>
 <s id="35">Enjoy!</s>
