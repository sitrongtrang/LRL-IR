  <s id="1.1">Hello, Doha.</s>
  <s id="1.2">Hello!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">Salaam alaikum.</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">I love coming to Doha.</s>
  <s id="3.2">It's such an international place.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">It feels like the United Nations here.</s>
 <s id="5">You land at the airport, and you're welcomed by an Indian lady who takes you to Al Maha Services, where you meet a Filipino lady who hands you off to a South African lady who then takes you to a Korean who takes you to a Pakistani guy with the luggage who takes you to the car with a Sri Lankan.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">You go to the hotel and you check in.</s>
  <s id="6.2">There's a Lebanese.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p7">
  <s id="7.1">Yeah?</s>
  <s id="7.2">And then a Swedish guy showed me my room.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="8">I said, "Where are the Qataris?"</s>
 <p id="p9">
  <s id="9.1">(Laughter) (Applause) They said, "No, no, it's too hot.</s>
  <s id="9.2">They come out later.</s>
  <s id="9.3">They're smart."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="10">"They know."</s>
 <s id="11">(Laughter) And of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.</s>
 <s id="12">You know, like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well.</s>
 <s id="13">My Indian cab driver showed up at the W, and I asked him to take me to the Sheraton, and he said, "No problem, sir."</s>
 <s id="14">And then we sat there for two minutes.</s>
 <p id="p15">
  <s id="15.1">I said, "What's wrong?"</s>
  <s id="15.2">He said, "One problem, sir."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p16">
  <s id="16.1">(Laughter) I said, "What?"</s>
  <s id="16.2">He goes, "Where is it?"</s>
 </p>
 <s id="17">(Laughter) I go, "You're the driver, you should know."</s>
 <s id="18">He goes, "No, I just arrived, sir."</s>
 <p id="p19">
  <s id="19.1">I go, "You just arrived at the W?"</s>
  <s id="19.2">"No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p20">
  <s id="20.1">(Laughter) "I was on my way home from the airport, I got a job.</s>
  <s id="20.2">I'm working already."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="21">(Laughter) He goes, "Sir, why don't you drive?"</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) "I don't know where we're going."</s>
 <s id="23">"Neither do I. It will be an adventure, sir."</s>
 <s id="24">(Laughter) The Middle East has been an adventure the past couple of years.</s>
 <s id="25">It is going crazy with the Arab Spring and revolution and all this.</s>
 <s id="26">Are there any Lebanese here tonight, by applause?</s>
 <s id="27">(Cheering) Lebanese, yeah.</s>
 <s id="28">The Middle East is going crazy.</s>
 <s id="29">You know the Middle East is going crazy when Lebanon is the most peaceful place in the region.</s>
 <s id="30">(Laughter) (Applause) Who would have thought?</s>
 <s id="31">(Laughter) Oh my gosh.</s>
 <s id="32">No, there's serious issues in the region.</s>
 <p id="p33">
  <s id="33.1">Some people don't want to talk about them.</s>
  <s id="33.2">I'm here to talk about them tonight.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="34">Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East, here's a serious issue.</s>
 <s id="35">When we see each other, when we say hello, how many kisses are we going to do?</s>
 <s id="36">(Laughter) Every country is different and it's confusing, okay?</s>
 <s id="37">In Lebanon, they do three.</s>
 <s id="38">In Egypt, they do two.</s>
 <s id="39">I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.</s>
 <p id="p40">
  <s id="40.1">I went to Egypt.</s>
  <s id="40.2">I went to say hello to this one Egyptian guy, I went, one, two.</s>
  <s id="40.3">I went for three -- He wasn't into it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="41">(Laughter) I told him, I said, "No, no, I was just in Lebanon."</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">He goes, "I don't care where you were.</s>
  <s id="42.2">You just stay where you are, please."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) (Applause) I went to Saudi Arabia.</s>
 <s id="44">In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two, and then they stay on the same side: three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 -- (Laughter) Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.</s>
 <s id="45">They're just a little bit tilted.</s>
 <s id="46">(Laughter) "Abdul, are you okay?"</s>
 <p id="p47">
  <s id="47.1">"I was saying hello for half an hour.</s>
  <s id="47.2">I'll be all right."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="48">(Laughter) Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.</s>
 <p id="p49">
  <s id="49.1">Why is that?</s>
  <s id="49.2">Are you too tired to go all the way around?</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p50">
  <s id="50.1">(Laughter) "Habibi, it's so hot.</s>
  <s id="50.2">Just come here for a second.</s>
  <s id="50.3">Say hello.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p51">
  <s id="51.1">Hello, Habibi.</s>
  <s id="51.2">Just don't move.</s>
  <s id="51.3">Just stay there, please.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="52">I need to rest."</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) Iranians, sometimes we do two, sometimes we do three.</s>
 <s id="54">A friend of mine explained to me, before the '79 revolution, it was two.</s>
 <s id="55">(Laughter) After the revolution, three.</s>
 <s id="56">So with Iranians, you can tell whose side the person is on based on the number of kisses they give you.</s>
 <s id="57">Yeah, if you go one, two, three -- "I can't believe you support this regime!"</s>
 <s id="58">(Laughter) "With your three kisses."</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) But no, guys, really, it is exciting to be here, and like I said, you guys are doing a lot culturally, you know, and it's amazing, and it helps change the image of the Middle East in the West.</s>
 <s id="60">A lot of Americans don't know a lot about us, about the Middle East.</s>
 <p id="p61">
  <s id="61.1">I'm Iranian and American.</s>
  <s id="61.2">I'm there.</s>
  <s id="61.3">I know, I've traveled here.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="62">There's so much, we laugh, right?</s>
 <s id="63">People don't know we laugh.</s>
 <s id="64">When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour, it came out on Comedy Central, I went online to see what people were saying.</s>
 <s id="65">I ended up on a conservative website.</s>
 <p id="p66">
  <s id="66.1">One guy wrote another guy.</s>
  <s id="66.2">He said, "I never knew these people laughed."</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p67">
  <s id="67.1">Think about it.</s>
  <s id="67.2">You never see us laughing in American film or television, right?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="68">Maybe like an evil laugh: "Wuhahaha."</s>
 <s id="69">(Laughter) "I will kill you in the name of Allah, wuhahahahaha."</s>
 <s id="70">(Laughter) But never like, "Ha ha ha ha la."</s>
 <p id="p71">
  <s id="71.1">(Laughter) We like to laugh.</s>
  <s id="71.2">We like to celebrate life.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="72">And I wish more Americans would travel here.</s>
 <s id="73">I always encourage my friends: "Travel, see the Middle East, there's so much to see, so many good people."</s>
 <s id="74">And it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.</s>
 <s id="75">For example, I don't know if you heard about this, a little while ago in the US, there was a Muslim family walking down the aisle of an airplane, talking about the safest place to sit on the plane.</s>
 <s id="76">Some passengers overheard them, somehow misconstrued that as terrorist talk, got them kicked off the plane.</s>
 <s id="77">It was a family, a mother, father, child, talking about the seating.</s>
 <s id="78">As a Middle Eastern male, I know there's certain things I'm not supposed to say on an airplane in the US, right?</s>
 <p id="p79">
  <s id="79.1">I'm not supposed to be walking down the aisle, and be like, "Hi, Jack."</s>
  <s id="79.2">That's not cool.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p80">
  <s id="80.1">(Laughter) Even if I'm there with my friend named Jack, I say, "Greetings, Jack.</s>
  <s id="80.2">Salutations, Jack."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="81">Never "Hi, Jack."</s>
 <s id="82">(Laughter) But now, apparently we can't even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane.</s>
 <s id="83">So my advice to all my Middle Eastern friends and Muslim friends and anyone who looks Middle Eastern or Muslim, so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos, everyone, if you're brown -- (Laughter) Here's my advice to my brown friends.</s>
 <s id="84">(Laughter) The next time you're on an airplane in the US, just speak your mother tongue.</s>
 <p id="p85">
  <s id="85.1">That way no one knows what you're saying.</s>
  <s id="85.2">Life goes on.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="86">(Laughter) Granted, some mother tongues might sound a little threatening to the average American.</s>
 <s id="87">If you're walking down the aisle speaking Arabic, you might freak them out -- (Imitating Arabic) They might say, "What's he talking about?"</s>
 <s id="88">The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters, is to throw in random good words to put people at ease as you're walking down the aisle.</s>
 <s id="89">Just as you're walking down -- (Imitating Arabic) Strawberry!</s>
 <s id="90">(Laughter) (Imitating Arabic) Rainbow!</s>
 <s id="91">(Laughter) (Imitating Arabic) Tutti Frutti!</s>
 <s id="92">(Laughter) "I think he's going to hijack the plane with some ice cream."</s>
 <p id="p93">
  <s id="93.1">Thank you very much.</s>
  <s id="93.2">Have a good night.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="94">Thank you, TED.</s>
 <s id="95">(Cheers) (Applause)</s>
