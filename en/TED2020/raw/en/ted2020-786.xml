  <s id="1.1">(Music) (Applause) I'm Jon M. Chu.</s>
  <s id="1.2">And I'm not a dancer, I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="2">I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets."</s>
 <p id="p3">
  <s id="3.1">Anybody?</s>
  <s id="3.2">Anybody?</s>
  <s id="3.3">Yeah!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers -- amazing, the best in the world -- and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street culture that blew my mind.</s>
 <s id="5">I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities.</s>
 <p id="p6">
  <s id="6.1">They could fly in the air.</s>
  <s id="6.2">They could bend their elbow all the way back.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="7">They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.</s>
 <s id="8">I'd never seen anything like that.</s>
 <s id="9">When I was growing up, my heroes were people like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.</s>
 <s id="10">I grew up in a musical family.</s>
 <s id="11">(Laughter) And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.</s>
 <s id="12">Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.</s>
 <s id="13">Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."</s>
 <s id="14">(Applause) And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.</s>
 <s id="15">But after seeing what I've seen, the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.</s>
 <s id="16">They're here, getting better and better every day.</s>
 <s id="17">And dance has progressed.</s>
 <s id="18">It is insane what dance is right now.</s>
 <s id="19">Dance has never had a better friend than technology.</s>
 <s id="20">Online videos and social networking ...</s>
 <s id="21">dancers have created a whole global laboratory online for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video created in Detroit, building on it within days and releasing a new video, while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.</s>
 <s id="22">And this is happening every day.</s>
 <s id="23">And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.</s>
 <s id="24">Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips, and may not have that opportunity, except for us.</s>
 <s id="25">So, we created the LXD, sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers, a justice league of dancers that believe that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.</s>
 <s id="26">A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can actually do it.</s>
 <p id="p27">
  <s id="27.1">And we're going to show you some today.</s>
  <s id="27.2">So, let me introduce to you, some of our heroes right now.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="28">We got Madd Chadd, Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.</s>
 <s id="29">Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.</s>
 <s id="30">Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.</s>
 <s id="31">(Applause) (Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me, I get a lot of different reactions actually.</s>
 <s id="32">Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little freaked out.</s>
 <s id="33">And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.</s>
 <s id="34">(Music) (Applause) J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it -- I actually visually kind of picture lines, and moving them.</s>
 <s id="35">I think of like, Transformers, like how panels open and then they fold, they fold in, and then you close that panel.</s>
 <s id="36">And then another thing opens, you close that.</s>
 <s id="37">(Music) (Applause) Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on when I'm dancing.</s>
 <s id="38">Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.</s>
 <s id="39">It's not really a conscious decision, "I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."</s>
 <s id="40">It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.</s>
 <s id="41">I got my name just because I was so young.</s>
 <p id="p42">
  <s id="42.1">I was young when I started.</s>
  <s id="42.2">I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="43">So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.</s>
 <s id="44">(Music) (Applause) L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy.</s>
 <s id="45">And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.</s>
 <p id="p46">
  <s id="46.1">That's not a krump move.</s>
  <s id="46.2">You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="47">And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.</s>
 <s id="48">And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it.</s>
 <s id="49">You know, you create power, then you tame it.</s>
 <s id="50">(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause)</s>
