  <s id="3.1">[Small thing.]</s>
  <s id="3.2">[Big idea.]</s>
  <s id="3.3">[Isaac Mizrahi on the Button] No one knows who invented the button.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="4">It might have shown up as early as 2000 BCE.</s>
 <s id="5">It was decorative when it first started, just something pretty sewn onto your clothes.</s>
 <s id="6">Then about 3,000 years later, someone finally invented the buttonhole, and buttons were suddenly useful.</s>
 <s id="7">The button and the buttonhole is such a great invention.</s>
 <s id="8">Not only does it slip through the buttonhole, but then it kind of falls into place, and so you're completely secure, like it's never going to open.</s>
 <s id="9">The design of a button hasn't changed much since the Middle Ages.</s>
 <s id="10">It's one of the most enduring designs in history.</s>
 <s id="11">For me, the best buttons are usually round.</s>
 <s id="12">There's either a dome button with a little shank, or there's just this sort of round thing with either a rim or not a rim, either two holes or four holes.</s>
 <s id="13">Almost more important than the button is the buttonhole.</s>
 <s id="14">And the way you figure that out is: the diameter of the button plus the width of the button, plus a little bit of ease.</s>
 <s id="15">Before buttons, clothes were bigger -- they were more kind of amorphous, and people, like, wriggled into them or just kind of wrapped themselves in things.</s>
 <s id="16">But then fashion moved closer to the body as we discovered uses for the button.</s>
 <s id="17">At one time, it was the one way to make clothes fit against the body.</s>
 <s id="18">I think the reason buttons have endured for so long, historically, is because they actually work to keep our clothes shut.</s>
 <s id="19">Zippers break; Velcro makes a lot of noise, and it wears out after a while.</s>
 <s id="20">If a button falls off, you just literally sew that thing on.</s>
 <s id="21">A button is kind of there for the long run.</s>
 <s id="22">It's not just the most elemental design ever, it's also such a crazy fashion statement.</s>
 <s id="23">When I was a kid, my mom knit me this beautiful sweater.</s>
 <s id="24">I didn't like it.</s>
 <s id="25">And then I found these buttons, and the minute the buttons were on the sweater, I loved it.</s>
 <s id="26">If you don't have good taste and you can't pick out a button, then let someone else do it, you know?</s>
 <s id="27">I mean that.</s>
