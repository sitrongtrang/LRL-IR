 <s id="1">I'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories.</s>
 <s id="2">Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment frozen within a fraction of time.</s>
 <s id="3">Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes.</s>
 <s id="4">But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?</s>
 <s id="5">What if a photograph could actually collapse time, compressing the best moments of the day and the night seamlessly into one single image?</s>
 <s id="6">I've created a concept called "Day to Night" and I believe it's going to change the way you look at the world.</s>
 <s id="7">I know it has for me.</s>
 <s id="8">My process begins by photographing iconic locations, places that are part of what I call our collective memory.</s>
 <s id="9">I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.</s>
 <s id="10">I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.</s>
 <s id="11">Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and shooting over 1,500 images, I then choose the best moments of the day and night.</s>
 <s id="12">Using time as a guide, I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time.</s>
 <s id="13">I can take you to Paris for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.</s>
 <s id="14">And I can show you the early morning rowers along the River Seine.</s>
 <s id="15">And simultaneously, I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.</s>
 <s id="16">And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.</s>
 <s id="17">I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air, and every single thing you see in this photograph actually happened on this day.</s>
 <s id="18">Day to Night is a global project, and my work has always been about history.</s>
 <s id="19">I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice and actually seeing it during a specific event.</s>
 <s id="20">And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata, an event that's actually been taking place since 1498.</s>
 <s id="21">The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.</s>
 <s id="22">And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is: this is not a timelapse, this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.</s>
 <s id="23">I am a relentless collector of magical moments.</s>
 <s id="24">And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.</s>
 <s id="25">The entire concept came about in 1996.</s>
 <s id="26">LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.</s>
 <s id="27">I got to the set and realized: it's a square.</s>
 <s id="28">So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage of 250 single images.</s>
 <s id="29">So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.</s>
 <s id="30">And as I pan my camera to the right, I noticed there was a mirror on the wall and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.</s>
 <s id="31">And for that one moment, that one image I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss for this one picture?"</s>
 <s id="32">And then I came back to my studio in New York, and I hand-glued these 250 images together and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!</s>
 <s id="33">I'm changing time in a photograph."</s>
 <s id="34">And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.</s>
 <s id="35">This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.</s>
 <s id="36">And I'm going to show you a little video that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me when I do these pictures.</s>
 <s id="37">To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this, most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker or a crane.</s>
 <s id="38">So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop capturing the entire day unfold.</s>
 <s id="39">One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.</s>
 <s id="40">And trust me when I tell you, this is the greatest seat in the house to have.</s>
 <s id="41">But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.</s>
 <s id="42">So once I decide on my view and the location, I have to decide where day begins and night ends.</s>
 <s id="43">And that's what I call the time vector.</s>
 <s id="44">Einstein described time as a fabric.</s>
 <s id="45">Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity.</s>
 <s id="46">I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.</s>
 <s id="47">One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.</s>
 <s id="48">I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph.</s>
 <s id="49">Now when I do these pictures, it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.</s>
 <s id="50">I build a photograph based on time, and this is what I call the master plate.</s>
 <s id="51">This can take us several months to complete.</s>
 <s id="52">The fun thing about this work is I have absolutely zero control when I get up there on any given day and capture photographs.</s>
 <s id="53">So I never know who's going to be in the picture, if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control.</s>
 <s id="54">It's at the end of the process, if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same, that I then decide who's in and who's out, and it's all based on time.</s>
 <s id="55">I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.</s>
 <s id="56">I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.</s>
 <s id="57">Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt, the great Hudson River School painter.</s>
 <s id="58">He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.</s>
 <s id="59">This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.</s>
 <s id="60">So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.</s>
 <s id="61">This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue of National Geographic.</s>
 <s id="62">I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.</s>
 <s id="63">I was literally on the side of a cliff, capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions, the moonlight lighting El Capitan.</s>
 <s id="64">And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.</s>
 <s id="65">The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity as time changed -- from day into night.</s>
 <s id="66">And on a personal note, I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.</s>
 <s id="67">And when that sun started to rise in the valley, I started to literally shake with excitement because I looked at the painting and I go, "Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting 100 years earlier."</s>
 <s id="68">Day to Night is about all the things, it's like a compilation of all the things I love about the medium of photography.</s>
 <s id="69">It's about landscape, it's about street photography, it's about color, it's about architecture, perspective, scale -- and, especially, history.</s>
 <s id="70">This is one of the most historical moments I've been able to photograph, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.</s>
 <s id="71">And if you look closely in this picture, you can actually see time changing in those large television sets.</s>
 <s id="72">You can see Michelle waiting with the children, the president now greets the crowd, he takes his oath, and now he's speaking to the people.</s>
 <s id="73">There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.</s>
 <s id="74">For this particular photograph, I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air and it was not very stable.</s>
 <s id="75">So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight, our horizon line shifted.</s>
 <s id="76">So for every picture you see, and there were about 1,800 in this picture, we both had to tape our feet into position every time I clicked the shutter.</s>
 <s id="77">(Applause) I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.</s>
 <s id="78">I think the two most important are patience and the power of observation.</s>
 <s id="79">When you photograph a city like New York from above, I discovered that those people in cars that I sort of live with everyday, they don't look like people in cars anymore.</s>
 <s id="80">They feel like a giant school of fish, it was a form of emergent behavior.</s>
 <s id="81">And when people describe the energy of New York, I think this photograph begins to really capture that.</s>
 <s id="82">When you look closer in my work, you can see there's stories going on.</s>
 <s id="83">You realize that Times Square is a canyon, it's shadow and it's sunlight.</s>
 <s id="84">So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.</s>
 <s id="85">So wherever the shadows are, it's night and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.</s>
 <s id="86">Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around.</s>
 <s id="87">But in a very unique and special way, I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.</s>
 <s id="88">They embody a new metaphysical visual reality.</s>
 <s id="89">When you spend 15 hours looking at a place, you're going to see things a little differently than if you or I walked up with our camera, took a picture, and then walked away.</s>
 <s id="90">This was a perfect example.</s>
 <s id="91">I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."</s>
 <s id="92">I watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.</s>
 <s id="93">They were more interested in using it as a backdrop.</s>
 <s id="94">They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away.</s>
 <s id="95">And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example, a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into.</s>
 <s id="96">The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself.</s>
 <s id="97">(Applause) And finally, my most recent image, which has such a special meaning for me personally: this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.</s>
 <s id="98">And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera, this is not a reserve.</s>
 <s id="99">I went specifically during the peak migration to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.</s>
 <s id="100">Unfortunately, when we got there, there was a drought going on during the peak migration, a five-week drought.</s>
 <s id="101">So all the animals were drawn to the water.</s>
 <s id="102">I found this one watering hole, and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving, I had a real opportunity to capture something unique.</s>
 <s id="103">We spent three days studying it, and nothing could have prepared me for what I witnessed during our shoot day.</s>
 <s id="104">I photographed for 26 hours in a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.</s>
 <s id="105">What I witnessed was unimaginable.</s>
 <s id="106">Frankly, it was Biblical.</s>
 <s id="107">We saw, for 26 hours, all these competitive species share a single resource called water.</s>
 <s id="108">The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years.</s>
 <s id="109">The animals never even grunted at each other.</s>
 <s id="110">They seem to understand something that we humans don't.</s>
 <s id="111">That this precious resource called water is something we all have to share.</s>
 <s id="112">When I created this picture, I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing, compressing time, exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.</s>
 <s id="113">As technology evolves along with photography, photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory, but they will compose a new narrative of untold stories, creating a timeless window into our world.</s>
 <s id="114">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="115">(Applause)</s>
