 <s id="1">On March 3, 1913, protesters parted for the woman in white: dressed in a flowing cape and sitting astride a white horse, the activist Inez Milholland was hard to miss.</s>
 <s id="2">She was riding at the helm of the Women’s Suffrage Parade- the first mass protest for a woman’s right to vote on a national scale.</s>
 <s id="3">After months of strategic planning and controversy, thousands of women gathered in Washington D.C.</s>
 <s id="4">Here, they called for a constitutional amendment granting them the right to vote.</s>
 <s id="5">By 1913, women’s rights activists had been campaigning for decades.</s>
 <s id="6">As a disenfranchised group, women had no voice in the laws that affected their– or anyone else’s– lives.</s>
 <s id="7">However, they were struggling to secure broader support for political equality.</s>
 <s id="8">They’d achieved no major victories since 1896, when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women.</s>
 <s id="9">That brought the total number of states which recognized a women’s right to vote to four.</s>
 <s id="10">A new, media-savvy spirit arrived in the form of Alice Paul.</s>
 <s id="11">She was inspired by the British suffragettes, who went on hunger strikes and endured imprisonment in the early 1900s.</s>
 <s id="12">Rather than conduct costly campaigns on a state-by-state basis, Paul sought the long-lasting impact of a constitutional amendment, which would protect women’s voting rights nationwide.</s>
 <s id="13">As a member of the National American Women Suffrage Association, Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip up support and rejuvenate the movement.</s>
 <s id="14">Washington authorities initially rejected her plan- and then tried to relegate the march to side streets.</s>
 <s id="15">But Paul got those decisions overturned and confirmed a parade for the day before the presidential inauguration of Woodrow Wilson.</s>
 <s id="16">This would maximize media coverage and grab the attention of the crowds who would be in town.</s>
 <s id="17">However, in planning the parade, Paul mainly focused on appealing to white women from all backgrounds, including those who were racist.</s>
 <s id="18">She actively discouraged African American activists and organizations from participating- and stated that those who did so should march in the back.</s>
 <s id="19">But black women would not be made invisible in a national movement they helped shape.</s>
 <s id="20">On the day of the march, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, a ground-breaking investigative journalist and anti-lynching advocate, refused to move to the back and proudly marched under the Illinois banner.</s>
 <s id="21">The co-founder of the NAACP, Mary Church Terrell, joined the parade with the 22 founders of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, an organization created by female students from Howard University.</s>
 <s id="22">In these ways and more, black women persevered despite deep hostility from white women in the movement, and at great political and physical risk.</s>
 <s id="23">On the day of the parade, suffragists assembled to create a powerful exhibition.</s>
 <s id="24">The surging sections of the procession included international suffragists, artists, performers and business-owners.</s>
 <s id="25">Floats came in the form of golden chariots; an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map of enfranchised countries.</s>
 <s id="26">On the steps of the Treasury Building, performers acted out the historical achievements of women to a live orchestra.</s>
 <s id="27">The marchers carried on even as a mob blocked the route, hurling insults and spitting at women, tossing cigars, and physically assaulting participants.</s>
 <s id="28">The police did not intervene, and in the end, over 100 women were hospitalized.</s>
 <s id="29">Their mistreatment, widely reported throughout the country, catapulted the parade into the public eye— and garnered suffragists greater sympathy.</s>
 <s id="30">National newspapers lambasted the police, and Congressional hearings investigated their actions during the parade.</s>
 <p id="p31">
  <s id="31.1">After the protest, the "Women’s Journal" declared, “Washington has been disgraced.</s>
  <s id="31.2">Equal suffrage has scored a great victory."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="32">In this way, the march initiated a surge of support for women’s voting rights that endured in the coming years.</s>
 <s id="33">Suffragists kept up steady pressure on their representatives, attended rallies, and petitioned the White House.</s>
 <s id="34">Inez Milholland, the woman on the white horse, campaigned constantly throughout the United States, despite suffering from chronic health problems.</s>
 <s id="35">She did not live to see her efforts come to fruition.</s>
 <s id="36">In 1916, she collapsed while giving a suffrage speech and died soon after.</s>
 <p id="p37">
  <s id="37.1">According to popular reports, her last words were, “Mr. President, how long must women wait for liberty?”</s>
  <s id="37.2">Though full voting inclusion would take decades, in 1920, Congress ratified the 19th amendment, finally granting women the right to vote.</s>
