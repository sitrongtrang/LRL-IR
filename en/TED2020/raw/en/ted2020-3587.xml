 <s id="1">Congratulations.</s>
 <s id="2">By being here, listening, alive, a member of a growing species, you are one of history's greatest winners -- the culmination of a success story four billion years in the making.</s>
 <s id="3">You are life's one percent.</s>
 <s id="4">The losers, the 99 percent of species who have ever lived, are dead -- killed by fire, flood, asteroids, predation, starvation, ice, heat and the cold math of natural selection.</s>
 <s id="5">Your ancestors, back to the earliest fishes, overcame all these challenges.</s>
 <s id="6">You are here because of golden opportunities made possible by mass extinction.</s>
 <s id="7">(Laughter) It's true.</s>
 <s id="8">The same is true of your co-winners and relatives.</s>
 <s id="9">The 34,000 kinds of fishes.</s>
 <s id="10">How did we all get so lucky?</s>
 <s id="11">Will we continue to win?</s>
 <s id="12">I am a fish paleobiologist who uses big data -- the fossil record -- to study how some species win and others lose.</s>
 <s id="13">The living can't tell us; they know nothing but winning.</s>
 <s id="14">So, we must speak with the dead.</s>
 <s id="15">How do we make dead fishes talk?</s>
 <s id="16">Museums contain multitudes of beautiful fish fossils, but their real beauty emerges when combined with the larger number of ugly, broken fossils, and reduced to ones and zeros.</s>
 <s id="17">I can trawl a 500-million-year database for evolutionary patterns.</s>
 <s id="18">For example, fish forms can be captured by coordinates and transformed to reveal major pathways of change and trends through time.</s>
 <s id="19">Here is the story of the winners and losers of just one pivotal event I discovered using fossil data.</s>
 <s id="20">Let's travel back 360 million years -- six times as long ago as the last dinosaur -- to the Devonian period; a strange world.</s>
 <s id="21">Armored predators with razor-edge jaws dominated alongside huge fishes with arm bones in their fins.</s>
 <s id="22">Crab-like fishes scuttled across the sea floor.</s>
 <s id="23">The few ray-fin relatives of salmon and tuna cowered at the bottom of the food chain.</s>
 <s id="24">The few early sharks lived offshore in fear.</s>
 <s id="25">Your few four-legged ancestors, the tetrapods, struggled in tropical river plains.</s>
 <s id="26">Ecosystems were crowded.</s>
 <s id="27">There was no escape, no opportunity in sight.</s>
 <s id="28">Then the world ended.</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) No, it is a good thing.</s>
 <s id="30">96 percent of all fish species died during the Hangenberg event, 359 million years ago: an interval of fire and ice.</s>
 <s id="31">A crowded world was disrupted and swept away.</s>
 <s id="32">Now, you might think that's the end of the story.</s>
 <s id="33">The mighty fell, the meek inherited the earth, and here we are.</s>
 <s id="34">But winning is not that simple.</s>
 <s id="35">The handful of survivors came from many groups -- all greatly outnumbered by their own dead.</s>
 <s id="36">They ranged from top predator to bottom-feeder, big to small, marine to freshwater.</s>
 <s id="37">The extinction was a filter.</s>
 <s id="38">It merely leveled the playing field.</s>
 <s id="39">What really counted was what survivors did over the next several million years in that devastated world.</s>
 <s id="40">The former overlords should have had an advantage.</s>
 <s id="41">They became even larger, storing energy, investing in their young, spreading across the globe, feasting on fishes, keeping what had always worked, and biding their time.</s>
 <s id="42">Yet they merely persisted for a while, declining without innovating, becoming living fossils.</s>
 <s id="43">They were too stuck in their ways and are now largely forgotten.</s>
 <s id="44">A few of the long-suffering ray-fins, sharks and four-legged tetrapods went the opposite direction.</s>
 <s id="45">They became smaller -- living fast, dying young, eating little and reproducing rapidly.</s>
 <s id="46">They tried new foods, different homes, strange heads and weird bodies.</s>
 <s id="47">(Laughter) And they found opportunity, proliferated, and won the future for their 60,000 living species, including you.</s>
 <s id="48">That's why they look familiar.</s>
 <s id="49">You know their names.</s>
 <s id="50">Winning is not about random events or an arms race.</s>
 <s id="51">Rather, survivors went down alternative, evolutionary pathways.</s>
 <s id="52">Some found incredible success, while others became dead fish walking.</s>
 <s id="53">(Laughter) A real scientific term.</s>
 <s id="54">(Laughter) I am now investigating how these pathways to victory and defeat repeat across time.</s>
 <s id="55">My lab has already compiled thousands upon thousands of dead fishes, but many more remain.</s>
 <s id="56">However, it is already clear that your ancestors' survival through mass extinction, and their responses in the aftermath made you who you are today.</s>
 <s id="57">What does this tell us for the future?</s>
 <s id="58">As long as a handful of species survive, life will recover.</s>
 <s id="59">The versatile and the lucky will not just replace what was lost, but win in new forms.</s>
 <s id="60">It just might take several million years.</s>
 <s id="61">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="62">(Applause)</s>
