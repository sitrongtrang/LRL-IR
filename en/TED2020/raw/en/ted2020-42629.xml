 <s id="1">Ah, earth's oceans.</s>
 <s id="2">They are beautiful, inspiring, life-sustaining.</s>
 <s id="3">They are also, as you're probably quite aware, more or less screwed.</s>
 <s id="4">In the Seychelles, for example, human activities and climate change have left corals bleached.</s>
 <s id="5">Overfishing has caused fish stocks to plummet.</s>
 <s id="6">Biodiversity is in peril.</s>
 <s id="7">So what can we do?</s>
 <s id="8">Well, some form of protection, obviously.</s>
 <s id="9">Nature is very resilient.</s>
 <s id="10">When marine areas are strategically protected, entire ecosystems can bounce back.</s>
 <s id="11">However, creating marine protected areas isn't easy.</s>
 <s id="12">First, you have the issue of figuring out where to protect.</s>
 <s id="13">This coral reef overlaps with that international fishing route, intersects with this fish hatchery.</s>
 <s id="14">Everything is interconnected.</s>
 <s id="15">And marine protection plans must take into account how one area affects another.</s>
 <s id="16">Then, there's the issue of getting everyone on board.</s>
 <s id="17">Coastal economies often rely on fishing and tourism.</s>
 <s id="18">If people think they can't do their work, there's no chance of getting the local buy-in you need for the area to be successful.</s>
 <s id="19">Marine protected areas must also be enforced.</s>
 <s id="20">That means the government itself must be deeply invested in the plan.</s>
 <s id="21">Token support will not cut it.</s>
 <s id="22">And finally, conservation requires money.</s>
 <s id="23">A lot of it.</s>
 <s id="24">Governments in island and coastal nations may want to protect their waters, but often these nations have very high debt and can't afford to prioritize conservation.</s>
 <s id="25">If we rely on philanthropic dollars alone to fund marine protection, we might get a small marine-protected area here, another little one there.</s>
 <s id="26">But we need more marine protected areas faster, to have lasting impact.</s>
 <s id="27">So what exactly does smart ocean conservation look like?</s>
 <s id="28">How do we get the money, government support and careful planning that takes into account both local economies and complex ecosystems?</s>
 <s id="29">We want to share with you an audacious idea from The Nature Conservancy.</s>
 <s id="30">It seeks to address all of these things in one fell swoop.</s>
 <s id="31">They've realized that debt held by island and coastal nations is the very thing that will enable them to achieve their conservation goals.</s>
 <s id="32">TNC's idea is to restructure this debt, to generate the funds and political will to protect reefs, mangroves and fisheries.</s>
 <s id="33">For example, if you refinance your house to take advantage of a better interest rate, maybe you use the savings to insulate your attic.</s>
 <s id="34">That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do for entire coastal countries.</s>
 <s id="35">Refinance the debt, then use the savings to create marine protected areas.</s>
 <s id="36">Of course, sovereign debt restructuring is more complicated than that, but you get the basic idea.</s>
 <s id="37">If investors put in 40 million dollars now, it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion for ocean conservation.</s>
 <s id="38">And this is how the work gets done.</s>
 <s id="39">Step one: negotiate the deal.</s>
 <s id="40">A coastal nation commits to protect at least 30 percent of its ocean areas.</s>
 <s id="41">In exchange, The Nature Conservancy bring investors, public funders and international development organizations to the table to restructure a portion of the nation's debt, leading to lower interest rates and longer repayment periods.</s>
 <s id="42">Step two: create a marine plan.</s>
 <s id="43">Simultaneously, The Nature Conservancy works with marine scientists, government leaders and local stakeholders to create a detailed conservation plan that integrates the needs of the ocean with the needs of the people.</s>
 <s id="44">Step three: activate for longevity.</s>
 <s id="45">TNC establishes an independently run conservation trust fund.</s>
 <s id="46">The savings from the debt restructure goes into it to support new marine protected areas.</s>
 <s id="47">The trust then holds the government accountable for its commitments, ensuring that the Blue Bonds finance real protection efforts.</s>
 <s id="48">Could this plan work?</s>
 <s id="49">It already has.</s>
 <s id="50">In 2016, TNC helped create a national conservation plan in the Seychelles.</s>
 <s id="51">TNC restructured 22 million dollars of the government's debt.</s>
 <s id="52">And in exchange, the government agreed to protect 30 percent of its marine areas.</s>
 <s id="53">Today, the Seychelles is on track to protect 400,000 square kilometers of ocean.</s>
 <s id="54">That's an area roughly the size of Germany.</s>
 <s id="55">The Seychelles is protecting its coral reefs, it's replenishing its fisheries, it's improving its resilience to climate change.</s>
 <s id="56">At the same time, it's strengthening its economy.</s>
 <s id="57">This success is making other governments take note.</s>
 <s id="58">Many want to be part of this.</s>
 <s id="59">There's an opportunity to scale this up, dramatically.</s>
 <s id="60">And fast.</s>
 <s id="61">TNC has identified 20 more nations where such a plan should be possible.</s>
 <s id="62">But to execute, they need seed capital.</s>
 <s id="63">And to put in place local teams who can develop conservation plans, work with all the stakeholders and structure the deals.</s>
 <s id="64">If they get the support they need over the next five years, they could protect four million square kilometers of ocean.</s>
 <s id="65">That's 10 Germanies.</s>
 <s id="66">This would increase the amount of protected areas in all of the world's oceans by an incredible 15 percent.</s>
 <s id="67">It would allow vast tracks of the world's coral reefs to replenish and give safe harbor to countless species.</s>
 <s id="68">This would be truly incredible.</s>
 <s id="69">And it's really just the beginning.</s>
 <s id="70">Because there aren't 20 countries in the world where this kind of debt conversion would work.</s>
 <s id="71">There are almost 100.</s>
 <s id="72">With this approach, everyone wins.</s>
 <s id="73">Governments, local citizens, funders, and most importantly, our oceans.</s>
 <s id="74">So in fact, we all win.</s>
 <s id="75">Ah, earth's oceans.</s>
