 <s id="1">My name is Amy Padnani, and I'm an editor on the obituaries desk at the "New York Times."</s>
 <s id="2">Or, as some friends call me, the angel of death.</s>
 <s id="3">(Laughter) In fact, people will ask me, "Isn't it depressing, working on obituaries and thinking about death all the time?"</s>
 <s id="4">But you know what I tell them?</s>
 <s id="5">Obits aren't about death, they're about life, they're interesting, they're relatable.</s>
 <s id="6">Often about something you never knew.</s>
 <s id="7">Recently, for example, we had the obit for the inventor of the sock puppet.</s>
 <s id="8">(Laughter) Everyone knows what a sock puppet is, but have you ever thought about who created it, or what their life was like?</s>
 <s id="9">Obits are a signature form of journalism.</s>
 <s id="10">An art form, if you will.</s>
 <s id="11">It's an opportunity for a writer to weave the tale of a person's life into a beautiful narrative.</s>
 <s id="12">Since 1851, the "New York Times" has published thousands of obituaries.</s>
 <s id="13">For heads of state, famous celebrities, even the person who came up with the name on the Slinky.</s>
 <s id="14">There's just one problem.</s>
 <s id="15">Only a small percentage of them chronicle the lives of women and people of color.</s>
 <s id="16">That's the impetus behind a project I created called "Overlooked," which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people who never got an obit.</s>
 <s id="17">It's a chance for the newspaper to revisit its 168-year existence and fill in the gaps for people who were, for whatever reason, left out.</s>
 <s id="18">It's a chance to right the wrongs of the past, and to refocus society's lens on who is considered important.</s>
 <s id="19">I came up with the idea when I first joined Obituaries in 2017.</s>
 <s id="20">The Black Lives Matter movement was at a rolling boil, and the conversation on gender inequality had just started bubbling up again.</s>
 <s id="21">And at the same time, I wondered, as a journalist and as a woman of color, what could I do to help advance this conversation.</s>
 <s id="22">People were coming out of the shadows to tell stories of injustices that they had faced, and I could feel their pain.</s>
 <s id="23">So I noticed we would get these emails, sometimes, from readers, saying, "Hey, why don't you have more women and people of color in your obituaries?"</s>
 <s id="24">And I thought, "Yeah, why don't we?"</s>
 <s id="25">Since I was new to the team, I asked my colleagues, and they said, "Well, the people who are dying today are from a generation when women and people of color weren't invited to the table to make a difference.</s>
 <s id="26">Perhaps in a generation or two, we'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries."</s>
 <s id="27">That answer just wasn't satisfying at all.</s>
 <s id="28">(Laughter) I wanted to know: Where are all the dead women?</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) So I started thinking about how we hear about people who have died, right?</s>
 <s id="30">Number one way is through reader submissions.</s>
 <s id="31">And so I thought, "Well, what if we were to look at international newspapers or scour social media?"</s>
 <s id="32">It was around this time when ...</s>
 <s id="33">Everything was swirling in my mind, and I came across a website about Mary Outerbridge.</s>
 <s id="34">She was credited with introducing tennis to America in 1874.</s>
 <s id="35">And I thought, wow, one of the biggest sports in America was introduced by a woman?</s>
 <s id="36">Does anyone even know that?</s>
 <s id="37">And did she get a New York Times obituary?</s>
 <s id="38">Spoiler alert -- she did not.</s>
 <s id="39">(Laughter) So then I wondered who else we missed.</s>
 <s id="40">And it sent me on this deep dive through the archives.</s>
 <s id="41">There were some surprises.</s>
 <s id="42">The pioneering journalist Ida B. Wells, who started the campaign against lynching.</s>
 <s id="43">The brilliant poet Sylvia Plath.</s>
 <s id="44">Ada Lovelace, a mathematician now recognized as the first computer programmer.</s>
 <s id="45">So I went back to my team and I said, "What if we were to tell their stories now?"</s>
 <s id="46">It took a while to get buy-in.</s>
 <s id="47">There was this concern that, you know, the newspaper might look bad because it didn't get it right the first time.</s>
 <s id="48">It was also a little weird to sort of look back at the past, rather than cover news stories of our day.</s>
 <s id="49">But I said, "Guys, I really think this is worthwhile."</s>
 <s id="50">And once my team saw the value in it, they were all in.</s>
 <s id="51">And so, with the help of a dozen writers and editors, we launched on March 8, 2018, with the stories of 15 remarkable women.</s>
 <s id="52">And while I knew that the work my team was doing was powerful, I didn't expect the response to be equally powerful.</s>
 <s id="53">I had hundreds of emails.</s>
 <s id="54">They were from people who said, "Thank you for finally giving these women a voice."</s>
 <s id="55">They were from readers who said, "I cried on my way to work, reading these stories, because I felt seen for the first time."</s>
 <p id="p56">
  <s id="56.1">And they were from colleagues of mine, who said, "I never thought a woman of color would be allowed to achieve something like this at the 'New York Times.'"</s>
  <s id="56.2">I also got about 4,000 reader submissions suggesting who else we might have overlooked.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="57">And some of those are my favorite stories in the project.</s>
 <s id="58">My all-time favorite is Grandma Gatewood.</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) She survived 30 years of domestic violence at the hands of her husband.</s>
 <s id="60">One day, he beat her so badly, beyond recognition, he even broke a broomstick over her head, and she threw flour in his face in response.</s>
 <s id="61">But when the police arrived, they arrested her, not him.</s>
 <s id="62">The mayor saw her in jail and took her into his own home until she could get back on her feet.</s>
 <s id="63">Then, one day, she read this article in "National Geographic" about how no woman had ever hiked the Appalachian Trail in its entirety alone.</s>
 <p id="p64">
  <s id="64.1">And she said, "You know what?</s>
  <s id="64.2">I'm going to do it."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="65">Reporters caught wind of the old grandma who is hiking through the woods.</s>
 <s id="66">And at the finish, they asked her, "How did you survive so rough a place?"</s>
 <s id="67">But they had no idea what she had survived before that.</s>
 <s id="68">So, "Overlooked" has become wildly successful.</s>
 <s id="69">It's becoming a TV show now, on Netflix.</s>
 <s id="70">(Laughter) (Applause) I cannot wait to see this thing come to life.</s>
 <s id="71">Something like 25 different publishers have reached out to me with interest in turning "Overlooked" into a book.</s>
 <s id="72">All of this clearly shows how timely and necessary this project is.</s>
 <s id="73">It's also a reminder of how newspapers document what's happening in our world every single day, and we have to make sure not to leave out key people.</s>
 <s id="74">That's why, even though it's been so meaningful to look back in the past, I'm plagued with the lingering question: "What about the future of obituaries -- how do I diversify those?"</s>
 <s id="75">That was my original problem, right?</s>
 <s id="76">So to start answering this question, I wanted to gather some information.</s>
 <s id="77">I went down to the sub-sub-basement level of the New York Times Building, to the archives.</s>
 <s id="78">We call it the morgue.</s>
 <s id="79">(Laughter) And I asked for some guidance from our archivist there.</s>
 <s id="80">He pointed me to a book called "New York Times Obituaries Index."</s>
 <s id="81">So we handed it to the New York Genealogical Society, and they digitized it for us.</s>
 <s id="82">And then a programmer wrote up a program that scanned all those headlines for "Mr.," Mrs.," "Lady," "Sir," all the sort of gender-defining terms.</s>
 <s id="83">And what we found was that from 1851 to 2017, only about 15 to 20 percent of our obits were on women.</s>
 <s id="84">So next, I worked with a programmer to build this tool, called the diversity analysis tool.</s>
 <s id="85">It's a very dry name, but bear with me, it's super helpful.</s>
 <s id="86">It breaks down the percentage of our obits month to month, women to men.</s>
 <s id="87">OK, if that doesn't sound like much to you, this is how I used to calculate it before.</s>
 <s id="88">(Laughter) So I asked this programmer to program in a goal, and that goal was 30 percent.</s>
 <s id="89">From the year of "Overlooked's" launch, March of 2018, to March of 2019, I was hoping we could get to 30 percent of our obits on women.</s>
 <s id="90">It was a number we hadn't achieved in a 168 years, and I'm happy to say we did it -- we got to 31 percent.</s>
 <s id="91">(Applause) It's awesome, but it's not enough.</s>
 <s id="92">Next we're hoping to get to 35 percent, and then 40 percent, until we achieve parity.</s>
 <s id="93">And then I'm hoping to partner with this programmer again, to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits.</s>
 <s id="94">That was something I wanted to do with "Overlooked" too, to include men of color, and I finally got to do it with a special section for Black History Month, where we told the stories of about a dozen black men and women.</s>
 <s id="95">Again, it was a really powerful experience.</s>
 <s id="96">Many of these people had been slaves or were a generation removed from slavery.</s>
 <s id="97">A lot of them had to make up stories about their past just to get ahead in life.</s>
 <s id="98">And there were these patterns of their struggles that came up again and again.</s>
 <s id="99">Elizabeth Jennings, for instance, had to fight for her right to ride on segregated street cars in New York City -- a hundred years before Rosa Parks did the exact same thing with buses.</s>
 <s id="100">It was just a reminder of how far we've come, and how much more we still have left to do.</s>
 <s id="101">"Overlooked" is including other marginalized people as well.</s>
 <s id="102">Recently, we had the obit for the computer programmer Alan Turing.</s>
 <s id="103">Believe it or not, this brilliant man never got an obituary, even though his work decoding German messages during World War II helps end the war.</s>
 <s id="104">Instead, he died a criminal for his sexual orientation, and he was forced to endure chemical castration.</s>
 <s id="105">Great things, like this obits project, do not come easily.</s>
 <s id="106">There were a lot of fits and starts as I worked hard to convince people it was worth getting it off the ground.</s>
 <s id="107">There were moments when I faced great self-doubt.</s>
 <s id="108">I wondered if I was crazy or if I was all alone, and if I should just give up.</s>
 <s id="109">When I've seen the reaction to this project, I know I'm not at all alone.</s>
 <s id="110">There's so many people who feel the way I do.</s>
 <s id="111">And so yeah, not many people think about obituaries.</s>
 <s id="112">But when you do, you realize they're a testament to a human life.</s>
 <s id="113">They're the last chance to talk about somebody's contribution on the world.</s>
 <s id="114">They were also an example of who society deemed important.</s>
 <s id="115">A hundred years from now, somebody could be looking into the past to see what our time was like.</s>
 <s id="116">I'm lucky, as a journalist, to have been able to have used this form of storytelling to help shift a narrative.</s>
 <s id="117">I was also able to get an established institution to question its own status quo.</s>
 <s id="118">Little by little, I'm hoping I can keep doing this work, and continue refocusing society's lens so that nobody else gets overlooked.</s>
 <s id="119">Thank you.</s>
 <s id="120">(Applause)</s>
