 <s id="1">I am so excited to be here.</s>
 <s id="2">Everything in America is so much bigger than in Europe.</s>
 <s id="3">Look at me -- I am huge!</s>
 <s id="4">(Laughter) It's fantastic!</s>
 <s id="5">And TED Talks -- TED Talks are where everybody has great ideas.</s>
 <s id="6">So the question is: Where do those great ideas come from?</s>
 <s id="7">Well, it's a little bit of debate, but it's generally reckoned that the average person -- that's me -- has about 50,000 thoughts a day.</s>
 <s id="8">Which is a lot, until you realize that 95 percent of them are the same ones you had the day before.</s>
 <s id="9">(Laughter) And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?</s>
 <p id="p10">
  <s id="10.1">I think things like, "Oh!</s>
  <s id="10.2">I know -- I must clean the floor.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p11">
  <s id="11.1">Oh!</s>
  <s id="11.2">I forgot to walk the dog."</s>
 </p>
 <s id="12">My most popular: "Don't eat that cookie."</s>
 <s id="13">(Laughter) So, 95 percent repetition.</s>
 <s id="14">That leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new.</s>
 <s id="15">And some of my new thoughts are useless.</s>
 <s id="16">The other day I was watching some sports on television, and I was trying to decide why I just don't engage with it.</s>
 <s id="17">Some of it I find curious.</s>
 <s id="18">This is odd.</s>
 <s id="19">(Laughter) Do you think it would be worth being that flexible just to be able to see your heel at that angle?</s>
 <s id="20">(Laughter) And here's the thing: I'm never going to be able to relate to that, because I'm never going to be able to do it, OK?</s>
 <s id="21">Well, not twice, anyway.</s>
 <s id="22">(Laughter) But I'll tell you the truth.</s>
 <s id="23">The truth is I have never been any good at sport, OK?</s>
 <s id="24">I've reached that wonderful age when all my friends say, "Oh, I wish I was as fit as I was when I was 18."</s>
 <s id="25">And I always feel rather smug then.</s>
 <p id="p26">
  <s id="26.1">(Laughter) I'm exactly as fit as I was when I -- (Laughter) (Applause) I couldn't run then.</s>
  <s id="26.2">I'm certainly not going to do it now.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="27">(Laughter) So then I had my new idea: Why not engage people like me in sport?</s>
 <s id="28">I think what the world needs now is the Olympics for people with zero athletic ability.</s>
 <s id="29">(Laughter) Oh, it would be so much more fun.</s>
 <s id="30">We'd have three basic rules, OK?</s>
 <s id="31">Obviously no drugs; no corruption, no skills.</s>
 <s id="32">(Laughter) It would be -- No, it's a terrible idea.</s>
 <s id="33">And I also know why I don't engage with sport when I watch it on television.</s>
 <s id="34">It's because probably 97 percent of it is about men running and men kicking things, men trying to look neatly packaged in Lycra.</s>
 <s id="35">There is -- (Laughter) Not always successfully.</s>
 <s id="36">There is -- (Laughter) There is so little female sport on television, that a young woman watching might be forgiven for thinking, and how can I put this nicely, that the male member is the very lever you need to get yourself off the couch and onto a sports ground.</s>
 <s id="37">(Laughter) The inequalities in sport are breathtaking.</s>
 <s id="38">So this is what happens to me: I have a brand new idea, and immediately I come back to an old one.</s>
 <s id="39">The fact is, there is not now, nor has there ever been in the whole of history, a single country in the world where women have equality with men.</s>
 <s id="40">Not one.</s>
 <s id="41">196 countries, it hasn't happened in the whole of evolution.</s>
 <s id="42">So, here is a picture of evolution.</s>
 <s id="43">(Laughter) We women are not even in it!</s>
 <s id="44">(Laughter) It's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly.</s>
 <s id="45">So -- (Laughter) It bugs me, and I know I should do something about it.</s>
 <s id="46">But I'm busy, OK?</s>
 <s id="47">I have a full-on career, I've got three kids, I've got an elderly mom.</s>
 <s id="48">In fact, if I'm honest with you, one of the reasons I came out here is because TED Talks said I could have 15 minutes to myself, and I never have that much time -- (Laughter) (Applause) So I'm busy.</s>
 <s id="49">And anyway, I already had a go at changing the world.</s>
 <s id="50">Here's the thing, OK?</s>
 <s id="51">Everybody has inside themselves what I call an "activation button."</s>
 <s id="52">It's the button that gets pressed when you think, "I must do something about this."</s>
 <s id="53">It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.</s>
 <s id="54">Maybe you face some kind of inequality, or you've come across an injustice of some kind, sometimes an illness strikes, or you're born in some way disadvantaged, or perhaps underprivileged.</s>
 <s id="55">So I was born gay, OK?</s>
 <s id="56">I've always known, I don't think my family were the least bit surprised.</s>
 <s id="57">Here is a picture of me aged four.</s>
 <s id="58">I look cute, but inside I genuinely believed that I looked like Clint Eastwood.</s>
 <s id="59">(Laughter) So my activation button was pressed when I had my kids -- three wonderful kids, born to my then-partner.</s>
 <s id="60">Now here's the thing: I work on television in Britain.</s>
 <s id="61">By the time they were born, I was already hosting my own shows and working in the public eye.</s>
 <s id="62">I love what I do, but I love my kids more.</s>
 <s id="63">And I didn't want them to grow up with a secret.</s>
 <s id="64">1994, when my son, my youngest was born, there was not, as far as I was aware, a single out, gay woman in British public life.</s>
 <s id="65">I don't think secrets are a good thing.</s>
 <s id="66">I think they are a cancer of the soul.</s>
 <s id="67">So I decided to come out.</s>
 <s id="68">Everybody warned me that I would never work again, but I decided it was absolutely worth the risk.</s>
 <s id="69">Well, it was hell.</s>
 <s id="70">In Britain, we have a particularly vicious section of the right-wing press, and they went nuts.</s>
 <s id="71">And their hatred stirred up the less stable elements of society, and we got death threats -- enough death threats that I had to take the kids into hiding, and we had to have police protection.</s>
 <s id="72">And I promise you there were many moments in the still of the night when I was terrified by what I had done.</s>
 <s id="73">Eventually the dust settled.</s>
 <s id="74">Against all expectation I carried on working, and my kids were and continue to be absolutely fantastic.</s>
 <s id="75">I remember when my son was six, he had a friend over to play.</s>
 <s id="76">They were in the next room; I could hear them chatting.</s>
 <s id="77">The friend said to my son, "What's it like having two mums?"</s>
 <s id="78">I was a little anxious to hear, so I leant in to hear and my son said, "It's fantastic, because if one of them's sick, you've still got another one to cook for you."</s>
 <s id="79">(Laughter) So my activation button for gay equality was pressed, and along with many, many others, I campaigned for years for gay rights, and in particular, the right to marry the person that I love.</s>
 <s id="80">In the end, we succeeded.</s>
 <s id="81">And in 2014, on the day that the law was changed, I married my wife, who I love very much, indeed.</s>
 <s id="82">(Applause) We didn't do it in a quiet way -- we did it on the stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London.</s>
 <s id="83">It was a great event.</s>
 <s id="84">The hall seats two-and-a-half thousand people.</s>
 <s id="85">We invited 150 family and friends, then I let it be known to the public: anybody who wanted to come and celebrate, please come and join us.</s>
 <s id="86">It would be free to anybody who wanted to come.</s>
 <s id="87">Two-and-half thousand people turned up.</s>
 <s id="88">(Applause) Every kind of person you can imagine: gays, straights, rabbis, nuns, married people, black, white -- the whole of humanity was there.</s>
 <s id="89">And I remember standing on that stage thinking, "How fantastic.</s>
 <s id="90">Job done.</s>
 <s id="91">Love triumphs.</s>
 <s id="92">Law changed."</s>
 <s id="93">And I -- (Applause) And I genuinely thought my activation days were over, OK?</s>
 <s id="94">So every year in that same hall, I host a fantastic concert to celebrate International Women's Day.</s>
 <s id="95">We gather the world's only all-female orchestra, we play fantastic music by forgotten or overlooked women composers, we have amazing conductors -- it's Marin Alsop there from Baltimore conducting, Petula Clark singing -- and I give a lecture on women's history.</s>
 <s id="96">I love to gather inspirational stories from the past and pass them on.</s>
 <s id="97">Too often, I think history's what I call the Mount Rushmore model.</s>
 <s id="98">It looks majestic, but the women have been entirely left out of it.</s>
 <s id="99">And I was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes -- I'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard for the right for women in Britain to vote.</s>
 <s id="100">And their slogan was: "Deeds, not words."</s>
 <s id="101">And boy, they succeeded, because women did indeed get the vote in 1928.</s>
 <s id="102">So I'm giving this talk about this, and as I'm talking, what I realized is: this was not a history lecture I was giving; this was not something where the job was done.</s>
 <s id="103">This was something where there was so much left to do.</s>
 <s id="104">Nowhere in the world, for example, do women have equal representation in positions of power.</s>
 <s id="105">OK, let's take a very quick look at the top 100 companies in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.</s>
 <s id="106">Top 100 companies: How many women running them?</s>
 <p id="p107">
  <s id="107.1">Seven.</s>
  <s id="107.2">OK.</s>
  <s id="107.3">Seven.</s>
  <s id="107.4">That's all right, I suppose.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="108">Until you realize that 17 are run by men called "John."</s>
 <s id="109">(Laughter) There are more men called John running FTSE 100 companies -- (Laughter) than there are women.</s>
 <s id="110">There are 14 run by men called "Dave."</s>
 <s id="111">(Laughter) Now, I'm sure Dave and John are doing a bang-up job.</s>
 <p id="p112">
  <s id="112.1">(Laughter) OK.</s>
  <s id="112.2">Why does it matter?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="113">Well, it's that pesky business of the gender pay gap.</s>
 <s id="114">Nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men.</s>
 <s id="115">And that is never going to change unless we have more women at the top in the boardroom.</s>
 <s id="116">We have plenty of laws; the Equal Pay Act in Britain was passed in 1975.</s>
 <s id="117">Nevertheless, there are still many, many women who, from early November until the end of the year, by comparison to their male colleagues, are effectively working for free.</s>
 <s id="118">In fact, the World Economic Forum estimates that women will finally get equal pay in ...</s>
 <s id="119">2133!</s>
 <s id="120">Yay!</s>
 <s id="121">(Laughter) That's a terrible figure.</s>
 <s id="122">And here's the thing: the day before I came out to give my talk, the World Economic Forum revised it.</s>
 <s id="123">So that's good, because that's a terrible -- 2133.</s>
 <s id="124">Do you know what they revised it to?</s>
 <s id="125">2186.</s>
 <s id="126">(Laughter) Yeah, another 53 years, OK?</s>
 <s id="127">We are not going to get equal pay in my grandchildren's grandchildren's lives under the current system.</s>
 <s id="128">And I have waited long enough.</s>
 <s id="129">I've waited long enough in my own business.</s>
 <s id="130">In 2016 I became the very first woman on British television to host a prime-time panel show.</s>
 <p id="p131">
  <s id="131.1">Isn't that great?</s>
  <s id="131.2">Wonderful, I'm thrilled.</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p132">
  <s id="132.1">But -- (Applause) But 2016!</s>
  <s id="132.2">The first!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="133">Television's been around for 80 years!</s>
 <s id="134">(Laughter) It may be television's not so important, but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?</s>
 <s id="135">2016, the UN were looking for a brand new ambassador to represent women's empowerment and gender equality, and who did they choose?</s>
 <s id="136">Wonder Woman.</s>
 <s id="137">Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?</s>
 <s id="138">(Laughter) Because no woman was up to the job.</s>
 <s id="139">The representation of women in positions of power is shockingly low.</s>
 <s id="140">It's true in Congress, and it's certainly true in the British Parliament.</s>
 <s id="141">In 2015, the number of men elected to the Parliament that year was greater than the total number of women who have ever been members of Parliament.</s>
 <s id="142">And why does it matter?</s>
 <s id="143">Here's the thing: if they're not at the table -- literally, in Britain, at that table helping to make the laws -- do not be surprised if the female perspective is overlooked.</s>
 <s id="144">It's a great role model for young people to see a woman in charge.</s>
 <s id="145">In 2016, Britain got its second female Prime Minister; Theresa May came to power.</s>
 <s id="146">The day she came to power she was challenged: just do one thing.</s>
 <s id="147">Do one thing in the first 100 days that you're in office to try and improve lives for women in Britain.</s>
 <p id="p148">
  <s id="148.1">And what did she do?</s>
  <s id="148.2">Nothing.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="149">Nothing.</s>
 <s id="150">Because she's much too busy cleaning up the mess the boys made.</s>
 <s id="151">Even having a female leader, they always find something better to do than to sort out the pesky issue of inequality.</s>
 <p id="p152">
  <s id="152.1">So I keep talking about equality like it matters.</s>
  <s id="152.2">Does it?</s>
 </p>
 <s id="153">Well, let's take a very quick look at the STEM industries, OK?</s>
 <s id="154">So science, technology, engineering and mathematics.</s>
 <s id="155">Pretty much important in every single aspect of our daily lives.</s>
 <s id="156">There is the thickest and most incredibly well-documented glass ceiling in the STEM industries.</s>
 <s id="157">What if the cure for cancer or the answer the global warming lies in the head of a young female scientist who fails to progress?</s>
 <s id="158">So I thought all these things, and I knew I had to do "Deeds, not words."</s>
 <s id="159">And I spoke to my wonderful friend, brilliant journalist Catherine Mayer in Britain, and we rather foolishly -- and I suspect there was wine involved -- (Laughter) We decided to found a brand new political party.</s>
 <s id="160">Because here's the critical thing: the one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.</s>
 <s id="161">We had no idea what we were doing, we didn't know how complicated it was to start a political party.</s>
 <s id="162">I thought, "It can't be that difficult, men have been doing it for years."</s>
 <s id="163">(Laughter) So we started by calling it "The Women's Equality Party."</s>
 <s id="164">And straightaway people said to me, "Why did you call it that?"</s>
 <s id="165">I said, "I don't know, I just thought we'd be clear."</s>
 <p id="p166">
  <s id="166.1">(Laughter) I didn't want what we were doing to be a secret, you know?</s>
  <s id="166.2">I just -- (Laughter) Some people said, "You can't call it that!</s>
  <s id="166.3">It's much too feminist!"</s>
 </p>
 <p id="p167">
  <s id="167.1">Ooh!</s>
  <s id="167.2">Scary word!</s>
  <s id="167.3">Ahh!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="168">I can't tell you how many times I've heard somebody say, "I'm not a feminist, but ..."</s>
 <s id="169">And I always think if there's a "but" in the sentence, it can't all be roses in the garden.</s>
 <s id="170">And then I started getting asked the hilarious question, "Are you all going to burn your bras?"</s>
 <p id="p171">
  <s id="171.1">Yes!</s>
  <s id="171.2">Because bras are famously made of flammable material.</s>
 </p>
 <s id="172">(Laughter) That's why all women spark when they walk.</s>
 <s id="173">(Laughter) Here's quick history sidebar for you: no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.</s>
 <s id="174">It's a story made up by a journalist.</s>
 <s id="175">Thank goodness journalism has improved since then.</s>
 <s id="176">So -- (Laughter) I announced what we were going to do in a broadcast interview, and straightaway, the emails started coming.</s>
 <s id="177">First hundreds, then thousands and thousands, from every age group: from the very young to women in their '90s, to hundreds of wonderful men.</s>
 <s id="178">People wrote and said, "Please, can I help?</s>
 <s id="179">Please, can I visit you at party headquarters?"</s>
 <s id="180">We didn't have a headquarters -- we didn't have a party!</s>
 <s id="181">We didn't have anything.</s>
 <s id="182">All we had was a wonderful, tight group of fabulous friends trying to answer emails pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.</s>
 <s id="183">We were all busy.</s>
 <s id="184">Many of us had careers, many of us had children, but we did what women do, and we shared the work.</s>
 <s id="185">And almost instantly, we agreed on certain fundamental things.</s>
 <s id="186">First thing: we want to be the only political party in the world whose main aim was to no longer need to exist.</s>
 <s id="187">That's a fantastic idea.</s>
 <s id="188">We wanted to be the only political party with no particular political leaning.</s>
 <s id="189">We wanted people from the left, from the right, from the middle, every age group.</s>
 <s id="190">Because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda: let's get equality in every aspect of our lives, and when we're finished, let's go home and get the other chores done.</s>
 <s id="191">(Laughter) And we wanted to change how politics is conducted.</s>
 <s id="192">I don't know if you have this, but in Britain we have two major political parties.</s>
 <s id="193">They're the dinosaurs of politics.</s>
 <s id="194">And how they speak to each other is shameful and poisonous.</s>
 <s id="195">I'm sure you've never had that kind of name-calling -- (Laughter) And lying here.</s>
 <s id="196">Wouldn't it be great if just one politician said, "Do you know, my opponent has a point.</s>
 <s id="197">Let's see if we can't work together and get the job done."</s>
 <s id="198">(Applause) And let's get more women into politics, OK?</s>
 <s id="199">Let's immediately get more women into politics by being the only political party to offer free childcare to our candidates, so they can get out of the house and start campaigning.</s>
 <s id="200">(Applause) Within 10 months, we had more than 70 branches of our party across the UK.</s>
 <s id="201">We stood candidates for election in London, Scotland and Wales in May 2016.</s>
 <s id="202">One in 20 people voted for our candidate for London Mayor.</s>
 <s id="203">And when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting, wonder of wonders, they began to talk about the need to tackle gender equality.</s>
 <s id="204">(Applause) You know, I've been promised change since I was a child.</s>
 <s id="205">It was always coming: women were going to stand shoulder to shoulder with men.</s>
 <s id="206">All I got were empty promises and disappointment -- enough disappointment to found a political party.</s>
 <s id="207">But here is my new idea for today -- this is my five percent, OK?</s>
 <s id="208">And this one is really good.</s>
 <s id="209">The fact is, this is not enough.</s>
 <s id="210">It is not enough to found one political party for equality in a single country.</s>
 <s id="211">What we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape.</s>
 <s id="212">And the wonderful thing about the model we have created is that it would work anywhere.</s>
 <s id="213">It would work in America, it would work in Australia, it would work in India.</s>
 <s id="214">It's like we've made the perfect recipe: anybody can cook it, and it's good for everybody.</s>
 <s id="215">And we want to give it away.</s>
 <s id="216">If you want to know what we did, we're giving it away.</s>
 <s id="217">Can you imagine if we could mobilize millions of women across the world to say, "That's enough!" to the traditional battles of politics?</s>
 <s id="218">To say, "Stop the bickering, let's get the work done."</s>
 <s id="219">We could literally change the world.</s>
 <s id="220">And I want that.</s>
 <s id="221">(Applause) I want ...</s>
 <s id="222">(Applause) I want that for our daughters, and I want it for our sons.</s>
 <s id="223">Because the fact is: equality is better for everyone.</s>
 <p id="p224">
  <s id="224.1">Come on people, let's activate!</s>
  <s id="224.2">Let's change the world!</s>
 </p>
 <s id="225">I know we can do it, and it wants doing!</s>
 <s id="226">(Applause)</s>
